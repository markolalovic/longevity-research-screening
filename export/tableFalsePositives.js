Dasatinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been shown to be efficacious in treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are resistant or intolerant to frontline imatinib. In clinical trials of dasatinib, the adverse events that arise during therapy are mostly mild to moderate in severity and are usually reversible and manageable with appropriate intervention. Cytopenias can be treated with dose modification or interruption. Pleural effusions can be effectively managed with prompt delivery of supportive care and dose modification. Patients at risk of cardiac abnormalities or bleeding-related events require careful monitoring. Pharmacokinetic analysis of dasatinib indicates interactions with a number of other agents and a complete treatment history should be taken before initiating therapy because mitigating drug-drug interactions are critical for patient safety.", relevance: "0.98"},

More recently, several categories of senolytics have been established, namely HSP90 inhibitors, Bcl-2 family inhibitors and natural compounds such as quercetin and fisetin. However, senolytic and senostatic potential of nanoparticles and surface-modified nanoparticles has never been addressed. In the present study, quercetin surface functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNPQ) were synthesized and their senolytic and senostatic activity was evaluated during oxidative stress-induced senescence in human fibroblasts in vitro. MNPQ promoted AMPK activity that was accompanied by non-apoptotic cell death and decreased number of stress-induced senescent cells (senolytic action) and the suppression of senescence-associated proinflammatory response (decreased levels of secreted IL-8 and IFN-Î², senostatic action). In summary, we have shown for the first time that MNPQ may be considered as promising candidates for senolytic- and senostatic-based anti-aging therapies.", relevance: "0.96"},

Oncogene-induced senescence is tumor suppressive but can also exacerbate tumorigenesis through the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors from senescent cells. Drugs that selectively kill senescent cells, termed senolytics, have proved beneficial in animal models of many age-associated diseases. Here, we show that the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, is a senolytic agent with broad activity. Senescent cells are sensitized to ouabain-induced apoptosis, a process mediated in part by induction of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2-family protein NOXA. We show that cardiac glycosides synergize with anti-cancer drugs to kill tumor cells and eliminate senescent cells that accumulate after irradiation or in old mice. Ouabain also eliminates senescent preneoplastic cells. Our findings suggest that cardiac glycosides may be effective anti-cancer drugs by acting through multiple mechanism. Given the broad range of senescent cells targeted by cardiac glycosides their use against age-related diseases warrants further exploration.", relevance: "0.95"},

Using a hypothesis-driven bioinformatics-based approach, we recently identified pro-survival pathways in human senescent cells that contribute to their resistance to apoptosis. This led to identification of dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q) as senolytics, agents that target some of these pathways and induce apoptosis preferentially in senescent cells. Among other pro-survival regulators identified was Bcl-xl. Here, we tested whether the Bcl-2 family inhibitors, navitoclax (N) and TW-37 (T), are senolytic. Like D and Q, N is senolytic in some, but not all types of senescent cells: N reduced viability of senescent human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVECs), IMR90 human lung fibroblasts, and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but not human primary preadipocytes, consistent with our previous finding that Bcl-xl siRNA is senolytic in HUVECs, but not preadipocytes. In contrast, T had little senolytic activity. N targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w, while T targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1. The combination of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w siRNAs was senolytic in HUVECs and IMR90 cells, while combination of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 siRNAs was not. Susceptibility to N correlated with patterns of Bcl-2 family member proteins in different types of human senescent cells, as has been found in predicting response of cancers to N. Thus, N is senolytic and acts in a potentially predictable cell type-restricted manner.

Recent data show the involvement of senescent cells in tissue ageing and some age-related diseases. Skin represents an ideal model for the study of ageing. Indeed, skin ageing varies between individuals depending on their chronological age but also on their exposure to various exogenous factors (mainly ultraviolet rays). If senescence traits can be detected with ageing in the skin, the senescent phenotype varies among the various skin cell types. Moreover, the origin of cellular senescence in the skin is still unknown, and multiple origins are possible. This reflects the mosaic of skin ageing. Senescent cells can interfere with their microenvironment, either via the direct secretion of factors (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype) or via other methods of communication, such as extracellular vesicles. Knowledge regarding the impact of cellular senescence on skin ageing could be integrated into dermatology research, especially to limit the appearance of senescent cells after photo(chemo)therapy or in age-related skin diseases.

Several early- and late-phase clinical trials for chronic myelogeneous leukaemia (CML) have demonstrated the direct inhibition of BCR-ABL fusion protein and SFKs, which led to dasatinib approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Phase III dose-optimization study was performed to compare different regimens, stating that dasatinib 100 mg once daily is now the recommended schedule for patients with chronic CML, and 140 mg once daily for patients with accelerated phase or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML, and for patients with Ph+ ALL until progression. Because of the myriad of critical roles of SFKs in biological processes, SFKs inhibition could induce numerous biological responses. Ongoing clinical trials evaluate dasatinib in the treatment of several solid tumours, including gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), prostate cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, sarcomas, NSCLC, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma and other haematologic malignancies as multiple myeloma.

We explored whether nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NTKs) play a key role in fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts (CFb), and could potentially serve as a target to reduce PO-induced cardiac fibrosis. Our studies were carried out in PO mouse myocardium induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Administration of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, via an intraperitoneally implanted mini-osmotic pump at 0.44 mg/kg/day reduced PO-induced accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and improved left ventricular geometry and function. Furthermore, dasatinib treatment inhibited NTK activation (primarily Pyk2 and Fak) and reduced the level of FSP1 positive cells in the PO myocardium. In vitro studies using cultured mouse CFb showed that dasatinib treatment at 50 nM reduced: (i) extracellular accumulation of both collagen and fibronectin, (ii) both basal and PDGF-stimulated activation of Pyk2, (iii) nuclear accumulation of Ki67, SKP2 and histone-H2B and (iv) PDGF-stimulated CFb proliferation and migration. However, dasatinib did not affect cardiomyocyte morphologies in either the ventricular tissue after in vivo administration or in isolated cells after in vitro treatment. Mass spectrometric quantification of dasatinib in cultured cells indicated that the uptake of dasatinib by CFb was greater that that taken up by cardiomyocytes. Dasatinib treatment primarily suppressed PDGF but not insulin-stimulated signaling (Erk versus Akt activation) in both CFb and cardiomyocytes. These data indicate that dasatinib treatment at lower doses than that used in chemotherapy has the capacity to reduce hypertrophy-associated fibrosis and improve ventricular function.", relevance: "0.86"},

However, in some dasatinib-treated leukemia patients, clonal lymphocytosis with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology develops, and this is associated with enhanced therapeutic responses. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for this paradoxical observation, we conducted detailed phenotypic and functional analyses of T-cell and NK-cell populations from 25 dasatinib-treated leukemia patients. All tested patients with LGL expansions (15/16) were cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin (IgG) seropositive with high frequencies of CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cells; 5/16 LGL patients also experienced symptomatic CMV reactivation during dasatinib therapy. Expanded T-cell and NK-cell populations exhibited late differentiated (CD27(-)CD57(+)) phenotypes; this was associated with a predisposition to apoptosis within the T-cell compartment and impaired NK-cell cytotoxicity. Only 3/9 non-LGL patients were CMV IgG seropositive. Dasatinib inhibited in vitro lymphocyte functions, similarly in LGL patients and controls. Notably, distinct CD8(high) and CD8(low) T-cell subsets were observed in LGL patients; this phenotypic dichotomy was also apparent in CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, and exhibited features consistent with antigen-driven activation. In addition, plasma levels of IP-10, IL-6, monokine induced by interferon-Î³ and interleukin-2R were significantly increased in LGL patients.

However, the occurrence of PAH with late onset in CML patients suggests a chronic pathological mechanism with an insidious onset rather than an acute inflammatory or cardiac aetiology. Dasatinib has a broader effect than other TKIs; the major known difference between dasatinib and other TKIs is the additional inhibition of Src family kinases. Therefore, Src inhibition was thought to play a role in the development of dasatinib-induced PAH. However, recently, it was also speculated that chronic dasatinib therapy may cause pulmonary endothelial damage, attenuate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction responses and increase susceptibility to PAH independently of the Src family kinase-induced mechanism. Dasatinib-induced PAH usually seems to be reversible with the cessation of the drug, and sometimes with PAH-specific treatment strategies.

Senescent cells have been demonstrated to play a causal role in driving aging and age-related diseases using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We previously demonstrated that the combination of dasatinib and the flavonoid quercetin is a potent senolytic improving numerous age-related conditions including frailty, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to identify flavonoids with more potent senolytic activity. Methods: A panel of flavonoid polyphenols was screened for senolytic activity using senescent murine and human fibroblasts, driven by oxidative and genotoxic stress, respectively. The top senotherapeutic flavonoid was tested in mice modeling a progeroid syndrome carrying a p16INK4a-luciferase reporter and aged wild-type mice to determine the effects of fisetin on senescence markers, age-related histopathology, disease markers, health span and lifespan. Human adipose tissue explants were used to determine if results translated. Findings: Of the 10 flavonoids tested, fisetin was the most potent senolytic. Acute or intermittent treatment of progeroid and old mice with fisetin reduced senescence markers in multiple tissues, consistent with a hit-and-run senolytic mechanism. Fisetin reduced senescence in a subset of cells in murine and human adipose tissue, demonstrating cell-type specificity. Administration of fisetin to wild-type mice late in life restored tissue homeostasis, reduced age-related pathology, and extended median and maximum lifespan. Interpretation: The natural product fisetin has senotherapeutic activity in mice and in human tissues. Late life intervention was sufficient to yield a potent health benefit. These characteristics suggest the feasibility to translation to human clinical studies.

Of the 228 patients who discontinued imatinib because of nonhematologic intolerance, 10 (4%) experienced the same severe nonhematologic AEs with dasatinib, with 4 of these patients (2%) discontinuing dasatinib because of cross-intolerance. Of the 43 patients who discontinued imatinib because of hematologic intolerance, 37 (86%) experienced a recurrence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic AEs with dasatinib, with 8 patients (19%) discontinuing dasatinib because of cross-intolerance. Of the 43 patients taking dasatinib at the optimized dose of 100 mg/d, 1 (2%) discontinued therapy because of recurrence of nonhematologic AEs and 3 (7%) because of recurrence of hematologic AEs. With a median treatment duration of 22 months, the estimated rates of progression-free survival and overall survival at 2 years were greater for patients with nonhematologic versus hematologic intolerance to imatinib who switched to dasatinib (progression-free survival, 94% vs. 68%, respectively; overall survival, 98% vs. 88%, respectively). Conclusion: Dasatinib could be an appropriate treatment option for imatinib-intolerant patients with CML, with cross-intolerance resulting in discontinuation in a few patients.", relevance: "0.83"},

Initially transient and migratory, the rash became fixed, papular, and vesicular and showed minimal response to corticosteroids. Biopsy demonstrated sparse perivascular and interstitial dermal neutrophilic infiltrates, without vasculitis or significant dermal edema. Aggregates of neutrophils were found within and surrounding lymphangiectases. Biopsy of a new onset papule 3 weeks later demonstrated papillary dermal edema, denser neutrophilic infiltrate, and vasculitis-like changes. These 2 histopathologic patterns of ND, early and late, resemble neutrophilic urticarial dermatitis (also known as neutrophilic dermatitis with systemic inflammation) and Sweet syndrome, respectively. Extensive workup did not reveal evidence of relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia, infection, or a coexisting systemic inflammatory disease. Dasatinib was discontinued and the eruption gradually resolved over 2.5 months. Still in molecular remission (no detectable BCR-ABL gene fusion), dasatinib therapy was recommenced at 3-month follow-up.

Dasatinib robustly antagonized the CML phenotype in vivo in our transgenic mouse model, and this effect included both mature and immature cell populations. However, similar to patients with CML, the fraction of LinnegSca-1+KIT+CD48negCD150+ hematopoietic stem cells was not reduced by dasatinib treatment, suggesting that these cells are not oncogene-addicted. Moreover, we observed differential effects of dasatinib in these animals as compared to wild-type (wt) animals: while granulocytes were significantly reduced in dtg animals, they were increased in wt mice. And Ter119+ erythrocytic and B220+ B cells were increased in dtg mice but decreased in wt mice. Finally, while dasatinib induced a shift from CD49b/NK1.1 positive NK cells from the bone marrow to the spleen in wt animals, there was no change in dtg mice.

Conversely, the number of megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow of dasatinib-treated mice was increased and the ploidy of MKs derived from bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro was elevated in the presence of dasatinib. Furthermore, a significant delay in platelet recovery after immune-induced thrombocytopenia was observed in dasatinib-treated mice even though the number of MKs in the bone marrow was increased relative to controls at all time points.

Patients were included if they had stage IIIb/IV SqCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and for whom treatment with standard chemotherapy had failed.

As Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, has been implicated as one of the major signaling molecules in VEGF-mediated neovascularization, the present study aimed to investigate whether dasatinib, a potent Src kinase inhibitor, could suppress pathological ocular neovascularization in murine models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Methods: Tube formation, scratch wounding migration, and cell proliferation assays were performed to measure the inhibitory effect of dasatinib on VEGF-induced angiogenesis in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. Murine models of OIR and laser-induced CNV were used to assess the preventive effect of an intravitreal injection of dasatinib on pathological neovascularization in the retina and choroid. Neovascularization and Src phosphorylation were evaluated with immunofluorescence staining. Results: Dasatinib efficiently inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial proliferation, wounding migration, and tube formation. In mice with OIR and laser injury-induced CNV, eyes treated with a single intravitreal injection of dasatinib exhibited significant decreases in pathological neovascularization compared with that of controls injected with vehicle. The dasatinib-treated OIR mice also showed a decrease in Src phosphorylation in the periretinal tufts. The intravitreal injection of dasatinib did not cause ocular toxicity at the treatment dose administered. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that dasatinib suppressed pathological neovascularization in the mouse retina and choroid. Therefore, dasatinib may be indicated for the treatment of ischemia-induced proliferative retinopathy and neovascular age-related macular degeneration.", relevance: "0.81"},

In a phase 3 dose optimization trial in patients with CML CP (CA180-034), the occurrence of pleural effusion was significantly minimized with dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) compared with other treatment arms (70 mg twice daily [twice daily], 140 mg QD, or 50 mg twice daily). Methods: To investigate the occurrence and management of pleural effusion during dasatinib treatment, and efficacy in patients with or without pleural effusion, data from CA180-034 were analyzed. Results: With 24-month minimum follow-up, 14% of patients treated with dasatinib 100 mg QD incurred pleural effusion (grade 3: 2%; grade 4: 0%) compared with 23% to 26% in other study arms. The pleural effusion rate showed only a minimal increment from 12 to 24 months.

Although blood leukocyte CMV antigen and CMV staining in colonic mucosa became negative after ganciclovir treatment, hemorrhagic diarrhea did not improve. However, after discontinuance of dasatinib, hemorrhagic colitis drastically improved and did not recur after administration of nilotinib. It is possible that hemorrhagic diarrhea occurred due to dasatinib-related hemorrhagic colitis. Previous case reports have indicated that CD8-positive T-lymphocytes infiltrate the colonic mucosa in dasatinib-related hemorrhagic colitis, and the same pathological findings were seen in our case.

Engaging senescence response is suggested as a key component for therapeutic intervention in the eradication of cancer. At the same time, delaying senescence or even promote death of accumulating apoptosis-resistant senescent cells is proposed as a strategy to prevent age related diseases. Although these two desired outcome present an intrinsic dichotomy, there are examples of promising natural compounds that appear to satisfy all the requirements to develop senescence- targeted health promoting nutraceuticals. Tocotrienols (T3s) and quercetin (QUE), albeit belonging to different phytochemical classes, display similar and promising effects in vitro when tested in normal and cancer cells. Both compounds have been shown to induce senescence and promote apoptosis in a multitude of cancer lines. Conversely, they display senescence delaying activity in primary cells and rejuvenating effects in senescent cells. More recently, QUE has been shown to display senolytic effects in some primary senescent cells, likely as a consequence of its inhibitory effects on specific anti-apoptotic genes (i.e. PI3K and other kinases). Senolytic activity has not been tested for T3s but part of metabolic and apoptotic pathways affected by these compounds in cancer cells overlap with those of QUE. This suggests that the rejuvenating effects of T3s and QUE on pre-senescent and senescent primary cells might be the net results of a senolytic activity on senescent cells and a selective survival of a sub-population of non-senescent cells in the culture.

Imatinib intolerance is also a concern. Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL and has helped address these concerns. Here, we review the clinical profile of dasatinib and discuss dosing strategies to manage these adverse events. Methods: References were obtained through literature searches on PubMed as well as from the Proceedings of Annual Meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, and European Hematology Association. Results: Initial studies of dasatinib showed that 70 mg twice-daily resulted in impressive hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL. Aside from hematologic events, the most common drug-related toxicities (mostly grade 1-2) in dasatinib clinical trials were fluid retention (including pleural effusion), diarrhea, skin rash, headache, hemorrhage, fatigue, nausea and dyspnea. A Phase III dose optimization study showed that the safety profile of dasatinib is improved and efficacy maintained when administered on a 100 mg once-daily dosing schedule compared with the 70 mg twice-daily schedule in patients with chronic phase (CP) CML. Conclusion: The safety profile of dasatinib is manageable. A 100 mg once-daily dose is now approved for use in patients with CP CML. A dose of 70 mg twice daily remains the recommended dosage for use in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL.", relevance: "0.79"},

Yet, hematologic toxicity and fluid retention demand a dose modification or treatment discontinuation in selected patients. Patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib were retrospectively evaluated based on the toxicity-guided administration of a dose-reduced dasatinib regimen. Patients were treated with an on/off regimen (3 to 5 days on, 2 to 4 days off) to allow regression of dasatinib-dependent off-target toxicity. Patients were followed up by routine hematologic and cytogenetic assessment and molecular monitoring to safeguard clinical response to the altered drug schedule. Thirty-three CML patients primarily in chronic phase with imatinib intolerance (n = 11) or resistance (n = 22) were investigated. Nonexclusive reasons for dose reduction were hematologic toxicity (17/33, 51%) and pleural effusions (18/33, 55%). On/off treatment with a weekend drug holiday significantly reduced pleural effusions and hematologic toxicity. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed effective disease control despite reduced total weekly dasatinib doses, either demonstrated by achieving an improved response level (12/31) or keeping the response level achieved by conventional continuous dosing (6/31). Of note, 10/12 patients with subsequently improved response have been treated for a minimum of 6 months with continuous dosing dasatinib regimens without having achieved the response level achieved after allowing drug holiday.

Apart from its known antileukemic activity, the drug produces several side effects including edemas and pleural effusions, which are supposedly triggered by activated immune cells. Effusion formation can be treated effectively by glucocorticosteroids. We have recently shown that low concentrations of dasatinib (<0.1 ÂµM) promote IgE-dependent secretion of histamine in basophils, especially in allergic individuals. In the current study, we asked whether glucocorticosteroids inhibit dasatinib-induced activation of basophils. Methods: Basophils were preincubated with dexamethasone, prednisolone and hydrocortisone for 24 h, and were then exposed to an anti-IgE antibody (normal basophils) or the allergens Bet v 1 and Phl p 5 (allergic patients) with or without low concentrations of dasatinib (0.025 ÂµM). After incubation, basophils were examined for histamine release and expression of CD63 and CD203c. Results: All three glucocorticosteroids were found to counteract IgE-dependent and dasatinib-enhanced histamine release in basophils in nonallergic and allergic individuals. In addition, glucocorticosteroids were found to inhibit anti-IgE-induced upregulation of CD63 and CD203c in the presence or absence of dasatinib. The inhibitory effects of glucocorticosteroids were dose-dependent (effective range: 1-10 ÂµM) and seen in all donors examined.

Picropodophyllin, particularly in combination with dasatinib and the combination ceritinib/dasatinib were effective in abrogating the proliferation. The ceritinib/dasatinib combination was applied to the primary cells of a 16-year-old girl with a long history of lung metastases, and was more effective than cabozantinib and olaparib. Therefore, the combination was used to treat the patient. The treatment was well tolerated, with toxicity limited to skin rush and diarrhea. A histopathological evaluation of the tumor after three months of therapy indicated regions of high necrosis and extensive infiltration of macrophages. The extension of the necrosis was proportional to the concentration of dasatinib and ceritinib in the area, as analysed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS).

In lung this can manifest as capillary leakage with pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or even pulmonary arterial hypertension. To understand how dasatinib causes endothelial dysfunction we examined the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib on both human pulmonary arterial macro- and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). The effects of dasatinib was compared to imatinib and nilotinib, two other clinically used BCR/Abl kinase inhibitors that do not inhibit Src. Real three-dimensional morphology and high resolution stiffness mapping revealed softening of both macro- and microvascular ECs upon dasatinib treatment, which was not observed in response to imatinib. In a dose-dependent manner, dasatinib decreased transendothelial electrical resistance/impedance and caused a permeability increase as well as disruption of tight adherens junctions in both cell types. In isolated perfused and ventilated rat lungs, dasatinib increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure, which was accompanied by a gain in lung weight. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 partly reversed the dasatinib-induced changes in vitro and ex vivo, presumably by acting downstream of Src. Co-administration of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 completely blunted the increased pulmonary pressure in response to dasatinib. In conclusion, a dasatinib-induced permeability increase in human pulmonary arterial macro- and microvascular ECs might explain many of the adverse effects of dasatinib in patients.

After a median follow-up of 9 months (min-max 3-36), the majority of patients did not demonstrate complete clinical and hemodynamic recovery, and no patients reached a normal value of mean pulmonary artery pressure (â¤20 mm Hg). Two patients (22%) died at follow-up (1 of unexplained sudden death and 1 of cardiac failure in the context of septicemia, respectively, 8 and 12 months after dasatinib withdrawal). The lowest estimate of incident PH occurring in patients exposed to dasatinib in France was 0.45%. Conclusions: Dasatinib may induce severe precapillary PH fulfilling the criteria of pulmonary arterial hypertension, thus suggesting a direct and specific effect of dasatinib on pulmonary vessels.

We aimed to assess toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for dasatinib plus capecitabine, estimate efficacy, and explore effects on angiogenesis. Experimental design: Dose levels (DL) were dasatinib 50 mg twice daily (DL1), 70 mg twice daily (DL2 and DL3), or 100 mg daily (DL3a); plus capecitabine on days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle, at 825 mg/m(2) twice daily (DL1 and DL2) or 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily [DL3 and DL3a (MTD)]. DL3a was expanded to evaluate safety/efficacy. Plasma samples were collected for biomarker analysis. Results: Thirty-one and 21 patients were treated in the escalation and expansion phases. Sixty percent of tumors were hormone receptor-positive. Most common adverse events (AE) were any grade nausea (58%), hand-foot syndrome (44%), diarrhea (33%), fatigue (33%), vomiting (31%), and asthenia (31%). Most common grade 3/4 AEs were hand-foot syndrome (12%), diarrhea (8%), fatigue (8%), pleural effusion (8%), and vomiting (6%). The MTD was defined at DL3a (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily and dasatinib 100 mg daily). Of 25 response-evaluable patients treated at DL3a, confirmed partial response was noted in 24% and stable disease in an additional 32%; median progression-free survival was 14.4 weeks. Significant decreases in plasma VEGF-A and increases in VEGFR-2 and collagen-IV were observed. Conclusions: Dasatinib 100 mg once daily plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily were tolerable and were associated with clinical benefit in 56% of response-evaluable patients.

Objective: In the present study, we addressed the question whether CAPE and Dasatinib target multiple pathways involved in tumor growth, proliferation and development on an in vivo rat model of glioma. Method: Expression analysis of proteins thought to be mediating proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, and invasion was carried out to delineate the antineoplastic action of CAPE and Dasatinib. Results: CAPE and Dasatinib modulate the expression of proteins having potential interactive crosstalk with major oncogenic pathways involved in glioma progression. Our results showed that combination treatment modulates the expression of p53 in group co-administered with CAPE and Dasatinib after glioma induction in comparison to the group induced with glioma only. EGFR and PCNA expression were significantly altered in the co-treated group in comparison with the glioma-induced group. The effects of CAPE and Dasatinib treatment were further evaluated on the AKT pathway by Western blot analysis. The co-treated group showed a significant reduction in the expression of AKT. The histopathological analysis further backed the antiproliferative and anti invasive effects of CAPE and Dasatinib. Conclusion: This study in totality suggests that the combinational therapy remarkably reduces the proliferation of glioma cells in vivo, suggesting that CAPE and Dasatinib therapy could be exploited for the management of gliomas without showing drug-related resistances and side effects, suggesting a high therapeutic potential of the therapy in glioma.", relevance: "0.78"},

However, patients receiving dasatinib frequently require dose reductions and treatment interruptions (treatment alteration). Methods: We prospectively analyzed the frequency and significance of treatment alteration during dasatinib therapy in patients with CML. In all patients, trough plasma concentrations of dasatinib (Cmin) at steady state were assessed on day 28 of therapy. Results: 28% of patients had their doses reduced at a median of 42 days, and 25% of patients had temporarily interrupted at a median of 54 days after treatment initiation. The overall dasatinib treatment alteration-free rate at 1 year was 66%.

Caveolin-1 is the principal structural component of caveolae in vivo. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that caveolin-1 functions as a transformation suppressor protein. In fact, caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are lost or reduced during cell transformation by activated oncogenes. Interestingly, the human caveolin-1 gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus (7q31.1). We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of caveolin-1 arrests mouse embryonic fibroblasts in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle through activation of a p53/p21-dependent pathway, indicating a role of caveolin-1 in mediating growth arrest. However, it remains unknown whether overexpression of caveolin-1 promotes cellular senescence in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts transgenically overexpressing caveolin-1 show: 1) a reduced proliferative lifespan; 2) senescence-like cell morphology; and 3) a senescence-associated increase in beta-galactosidase activity. These results indicate for the first time that the expression of caveolin-1 in vivo is sufficient to promote and maintain the senescent phenotype. Subcytotoxic oxidative stress is known to induce premature senescence in diploid fibroblasts. Interestingly, we show that subcytotoxic level of hydrogen peroxide induces premature senescence in NIH 3T3 cells and increases endogenous caveolin-1 expression. Importantly, quercetin and vitamin E, two antioxidant agents, successfully prevent the premature senescent phenotype and the up-regulation of caveolin-1 induced by hydrogen peroxide. Also, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide alone, but not in combination with quercetin, stimulates the caveolin-1 promoter activity. Interestingly, premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide is greatly reduced in NIH 3T3 cells harboring antisense caveolin-1. Importantly, induction of premature senescence is recovered when caveolin-1 levels are restored. Taken together, these results clearly indicate a central role for caveolin-1 in promoting cellular senescence and they suggest the hypothesis that premature senescence may represent a tumor suppressor function mediated by caveolin-1 in vivo.", relevance: "0.78"},

Here, we investigated whether expression of LYN, a member of the SFK family, is associated with patient survival, the efficacy of dasatinib, and/or NSCLC cell viability. LYN expression was associated with poor overall survival in a multivariate analysis, and this association was strongest in non-smoker female patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC). In lung ADC cells, LYN expression enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Dasatinib inhibited LYN activity and decreased cell viability in LYN-positive ADC cell lines and xenografts.

In this trial (the first-line DADI trial) we aimed to assess molecular relapse-free survival at 6 months after discontinuation of dasatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had been treated with first-line dasatinib and had maintained deep molecular response for at least 1 year. Methods: The first-line DADI trial was a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial done at 23 hospitals in Japan. Patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia without hepatosplenomegaly and extramedullary mass, who received at least 24-month dasatinib treatment and had a sustained deep molecular response (defined as BCR-ABL1/ABL1 international scale â¤0Â·0069% in at least four successive samples spanning a 12 month period) were enrolled. Other eligibility criteria were an age of 15 years or older, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2, and no primary organ dysfunction. The primary outcome was molecular relapse-free survival (also known as treatment-free remission) after discontinuation of dasatinib at 6 months and was analysed in all patients who completed the 12-month consolidation phase. Safety was assessed in all patients who received treatment. This study closed early due to accrual and is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000011099). Findings: Between Sept 20, 2013 and July 12, 2016, 68 patients who had a deep molecular response after receiving first-line dasatinib for at least 24 months were enrolled and assigned to the consolidation phase. Nine patients were excluded during the consolidation phase and one patient was excluded after study completion because of meeting exclusion criteria. 58 patients discontinued dasatinib and were assessed. 32 (55%) of 58 patients had treatment-free remission at 6 months after dasatinib discontinuation, and median follow-up was 23Â·3 months (IQR 11Â·7-31Â·0). Treatment-free remission at 6 months was 55Â·2% (95% CI 43Â·7-69Â·6). No non-haematological adverse events worse than grade 2 occurred before dasatinib discontinuation. The most common haematological adverse event was anaemia (14 [21%] of 68 treated patients); three (4%) of 68 treated patients had grade 3 neutropenia and one (1%) had grade 4 lymphopenia.

Prostate cancer patients with a high risk of developing metastases have few treatment options, none of which can result in a durable cure. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of a SRC inhibitor, dasatinib, on the ability of human prostate cancer cell to complete key steps in the metastatic process, including invasion and angiogenesis. Dasatinib treatment impaired the metastatic phenotypes of the human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP, by significantly reducing migration and invasion in modified Boyden chambers. Inhibition of phosphorylation, and therefore enhanced activation, of SRC and key downstream signaling pathway elements, including FAK, STAT3, Paxillin, and Akt, as determined by Western blotting, also was observed. This suggests that dasatinib interferes with critical cell functions associated with the metastatic cascade. Dasatinib also had direct effects on the ability of microvascular endothelial cells to form tubes in vitro and impaired the ability of PC-3 cells to induce angiogenesis in vivo.

Experimental design: Dasatinib was started concurrently with radiotherapy. Vandetanib was started 8 days later. We tested increasing doses of vandetanib (65 and 85 mg/m(2) once daily) and dasatinib (65 and 85 mg/m(2) twice daily). Dose-limiting toxicities were evaluated during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Plasma pharmacokinetics was obtained on days 8 and 42 Â± 3 in all patients and concomitantly with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when possible. Inhibition of targets of dasatinib in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was evaluated. Results: Twenty-five patients were treated. Treatment was well tolerated. The median duration of treatment was 184 days. Diarrhea was the most significant toxicity. Three patients experienced substantial myelosuppression. The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of vandetanib was comparable with previous studies.

Understanding the role of particular tyrosine kinases in malignancies has allowed for the design of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which can target these enzymes and interfere with downstream signaling. TKIs have proven to be successful in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and other malignancies. Scattered reports have suggested that these agents appear to affect blood glucose (BG). We retrospectively studied the BG concentrations in diabetic (17) and nondiabetic (61) patients treated with dasatinib (8), imatinib (39), sorafenib (23), and sunitinib (30) in our clinical practice. Mean declines of BG were dasatinib (53 mg/dL), imatinib (9 mg/dL), sorafenib (12 mg/dL), and sunitinib (14 mg/dL). All these declines in BG were statistically significant. Of note, 47% (8/17) of the patients with diabetes were able to discontinue their medications, including insulin in some patients. Only one diabetic patient developed symptomatic hypoglycemia while on sunitinib. The mechanism for the hypoglycemic effect of these drugs is unclear, but of the four agents tested, c-kit and PDGFRÎ² are the common target kinases. Clinicians should keep the potential hypoglycemic effects of these agents in mind; modification of hypoglycemic agents may be required in diabetic patients. These results also suggest that inhibition of a tyrosine kinase, be it c-kit, PDGFRÎ² or some other undefined target, may improve diabetes mellitus BG control and it deserves further study as a potential novel therapeutic option.", relevance: "0.77"},

Methods: In phase 1, 16 men received dasatinib 50 to 120 mg once daily and docetaxel 60 to 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. In phase 2, 30 additional men received dasatinib 100 mg once daily/docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. Efficacy endpoints included changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), measurable disease, bone scans, and markers of bone metabolism. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also studied. Results: Combination dasatinib and docetaxel therapy was generally well tolerated. Thirteen of 46 patients (28%) had a grade 3-4 toxicity. Drug-drug interactions and a maximum tolerated dose were not identified. Durable 50% PSA declines occurred in 26 of 46 patients (57%). Of 30 patients with measurable disease, 18 (60%) had a partial response. Fourteen patients (30%) had disappearance of a lesion on bone scan. In bone marker assessments, 33 of 38 (87%) and 26 of 34 (76%) had decreases in urinary N-telopeptide or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (61%) received single-agent dasatinib after docetaxel discontinuation and had stabilization of disease for an additional 1 to 12 months. Conclusions: The high objective response rate and favorable toxicity profile are promising and justify randomized studies of docetaxel and dasatinib in castration-resistant PC. Parallel declines in levels of PSA and bone markers are consistent with cotargeting of epithelial and bone compartments of the cancer. Treatment with single-agent dasatinib following docetaxel cessation warrants further study. Cancer 2012;. Â© 2011 American Cancer Society.", relevance: "0.76"},

Nine hallmarks have been identified based on their alteration during aging and their capacity to increase longevity. The pathways and the molecular mechanisms to improve lifespan and healthspan are controlled by behavioral, pharmacologic and dietary factors, which remain largely unknown. Among them, naturally occurring compounds, such as polyphenols, are considered potential antiaging agents, because of their ability to modulate some of the evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of aging, including oxidative damage, inflammation, cell senescence, and autophagy. Initially, these compounds gained researchers attention due to their ability to extend the lifespan of simple model organisms. More recently, some of them have been proposed as senolytic agents to protect against age-related disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The intent of this review is to present the most validated molecular mechanisms regulating ageing and longevity and critically analyze how selected polyphenols, namely resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin and catechins, can interfere with these mechanisms.", relevance: "0.76"},

Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment and first-line treatment for CML in chronic phase. In this article, the development of dasatinib as a treatment for patients with CML is reviewed. Methods: This is a review of the relevant literature regarding dasatinib development in CML (2003-2013). Results: Dasatinib demonstrates efficacy against most BCR-ABL mutations arising during imatinib therapy and is effective in treating patients with imatinib resistance due to other mechanisms. Randomized trial data show that first-line dasatinib provides superior responses compared with imatinib and enables patients to achieve early, deep responses correlated with improved longer-term outcomes. Dasatinib has a generally acceptable safety profile, with most adverse events (AEs) proving manageable and reversible. Cytopenias are commonly observed with dasatinib, and some nonhematologic AEs including pleural effusion have been consistently reported.

We conducted a phase II trial of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib for advanced NSCLC. We tested the hypotheses that the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or SFK or modulation of serum cytokines may predict a response to dasatinib. Patients and methods: Patients received dasatinib as first-line therapy. Response was measured by tumor size on computed tomography scans and by metabolic activity on positron emission tomography scans. Tissue samples taken before patients received dasatinib were tested for EGFR and Kras mutation and phosphorylated SFK expression. Results: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. The overall disease control rate (partial responses plus stable disease) for dasatinib was 43%. One patient had a partial response to therapy. Eleven patients (32%) had a metabolic response to dasatinib. SFK activation and EGFR and Kras mutations in tumor tissue did not predict response to dasatinib. Significant toxicities included fatigue and dyspnea. The presence of a pleural effusion before dasatanib therapy predicted the development of a clinically significant effusion during therapy. Conclusion: Dasatinib as a single agent had modest clinical activity that was lower than that generally observed in patients with NSCLC who receive chemotherapy. Pleural effusion was an expected and problematic toxicity that was successfully treated with steroids, diuretics, and dose interruptions. Marked activity in one patient and prolonged stable disease in four others suggested a potential subpopulation of patients with dasatinib-sensitive NSCLC.", relevance: "0.76"},

Patients and methods: Information on CML-CP patients switched from imatinib to nilotinib or dasatinib as second-line therapy was collected retrospectively from 122 US hematologists and oncologists through an online medical chart review. Progression, PFS, and OS were compared using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, and treatment changes using chi-square tests. Results: Of 597 imatinib resistant or intolerant patients, 301 initiated nilotinib and 296 dasatinib as second-line therapy. Nilotinib was associated with a lower risk of progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; p = 0.021) and longer PFS (HR = 0.48; p = 0.030) than dasatinib, with a median follow-up time of 11 months for nilotinib and 10 months for dasatinib. Nilotinib patients had a lower estimated hazard of mortality than dasatinib patients, though not statistically significant (HR = 0.46; p = 0.067). When treatment changes were classified by the physicians justifications, fewer nilotinib patients had treatment changes due to ineffectiveness (2.0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.041) or drug holidays due to intolerance (0.0% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.024) than dasatinib patients. Conclusions: Among CML-CP patients in this retrospective chart review who switched from imatinib to either nilotinib or dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression and longer PFS than dasatinib.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive phenotypic and clonotypic assessment of expanded (TCR-VÎ²+) and residual (TCR-VÎ²-) CD8+ T-cell populations in T-LGLL and dasatinib-treated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. The dominant CD8+ TCR-VÎ²+ expansions in T-LGLL patients were largely monoclonal and highly differentiated, whereas the dominant CD8+ TCR-VÎ²+ expansions in dasatinib-treated CML patients were oligoclonal or polyclonal, and displayed a broad range of memory phenotypes.

The tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor dasatinib is 325-fold more potent against Bcr-Abl TK than imatinib in vitro, significantly inhibiting wild-type KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta TKs, and is active against cells carrying the mutant KIT-D816V gene. Experimental design: In this phase 2, open-label study, the efficacy of dasatinib (140 mg/d) was investigated in 67 patients with various Ph- myeloid disorders, including SM (n = 33; 28 KIT-D816V positive). Results: The overall response rate to dasatinib in patients with SM was 33%. Only two patients, one with SM-myelofibrosis and one with SM-chronic eosinophilic leukemia, achieved complete response (elimination of mastocytosis) lasting for 5 and 16 months, respectively. Both patients were negative for KIT-D816V mutation, had low tryptase levels, abnormal WBC counts, and anemia, and had failed prior therapy with erythropoietin.

However, a decrease in adherence leads to undesired therapeutic outcomes. In this study, the relationships among adherence, pharmacokinetics, response, and adverse effects for dasatinib treatment were prospectively investigated. Methods: This study was a prospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed CML at 4 general hospitals and 1 university hospital. Patients started to receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily. A Medication Event Monitoring System was used to assess medication adherence and the medication possession ratio during the 12 months. Plasma concentrations of dasatinib were measured using liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and therapy responses were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Results: Ten patients were included. An extremely high medication adherence for dasatinib was observed; the median medication possession ratio was 99.4%. All 9 CML patients with breakpoints in the major BCR-ABL achieved major molecular response (MMR; major BCR-ABL transcript level below 0.1% on the International Scale) within 12 months, and 5 achieved MMR within 6 months.

Dose escalation began with dasatinib 70 mg orally (PO) daily and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) weekly. Results: Forty-seven patients (15 men; median age = 55 years; median number of prior systemic treatments = 4) were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 fatigue and dehydration, with the maximum tolerated dose being dasatinib 100 mg PO qd and gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) IV weekly. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were anemia (21.5 %), thrombocytopenia (26.2 %), leukopenia (26.2 %), and pleural effusion (10.7 %). Six of 47 patients attained stable disease (SD) â¥ 6 months or partial response including 2 of 8 patients with pancreatic cancer (SD â¥ 6 months; both gemcitabine-refractory), 2 of 3 patients with thymoma (SD for 9.8 and 15 months), 1 of 1 patient with anal squamous cancer (SD 15 months) and 1 of 5 patients with inflammatory breast cancer. No significant changes in circulating tumor cells or interleukin-8 levels were observed. Conclusions: The combination was well tolerated at doses of dasatinib 100 mg PO daily and gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) IV weekly.

Methods: Ten patients in various phases of CML, not responding to imatinib and started on dasatinib, were included and analyzed. The baseline characteristics of the patients and their salient features including the duration and response to initial therapy as well as to dasatinib, were noted. Results: Before starting dasatinib three patients were in chronic phase of CML while seven others were in the progressive phase (accelerated and blast phase) of CML. Half the patients developed transient grade 3 and 4 toxicities to dasatinib. Overall, the tolerability of the drug in all 10 patients was acceptable and none discontinued treatment. Three patients died due to progressive disease while the remaining seven are continuing the drug with the disease still under cytogenetic or hematological remission.

However, patients with BCR-ABL1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and subsets of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia are at high risk of relapse despite kinase inhibition therapy, necessitating novel treatment strategies. We previously reported synthetic lethality in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia cells by blocking both calcineurin/NFAT signaling and BCR-ABL1, independent of drug efflux inhibition by cyclosporine. Here, using RNA-interference we confirm that calcineurin inhibition sensitizes BCR-ABL1(+) cells to tyrosine kinase inhibition in vitro. However, when we performed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of dasatinib and cyclosporine in mice, we found that co-administration of cyclosporine increases peak concentrations and the area under the curve of dasatinib, which contributes to the enhanced disease control. We also report the clinical experience of two subjects in whom we observed more hematopoietic toxicity than expected while enrolled in a Phase Ib trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of adding cyclosporine to dasatinib in humans.

Here, the oral tyrosine kinase Src inhibitor, dasatinib, was investigated in combination with FOLFOX and cetuximab.Experimental Design: We performed a phase IB/II study of 77 patients with previously treated mCRC. Primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. Using a 3 + 3 design, patients received FOLFOX6 with cetuximab and escalating doses of dasatinib (100, 150, 200 mg daily), followed by a 12-patient expansion cohort at 150 mg. Phase II studies evaluated FOLFOX plus dasatinib 100 mg in KRAS c12/13mut patients or in combination with cetuximab if KRAS c12/13WT FAK and paxillin were utilized as surrogate blood biomarkers of Src inhibition, and paired biopsies of liver metastases were obtained in patients in the expansion cohort.Results: In phase IB, the DLTs were grade 3/4 fatigue (20%) and neutropenia (23%).

The recommended dose of dasatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was changed from 70 mg twice daily to 100 mg once daily following a Phase III dose-optimization study. To better understand the superior benefit-risk profile of dasatinib 100 mg once daily, exposure-response was characterized for efficacy (major cytogenetic response) and safety (pleural effusion). Patients and methods: Dasatinib exposure in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was determined by population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from seven dasatinib clinical studies (N = 981), including the Phase III dose-optimization study (n = 567). Data from the Phase III study were then used to characterize exposure-response relationships for the four dasatinib treatment regimens investigated (100 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, 140 mg once daily, and 70 mg twice daily). Results: Major cytogenetic response was significantly (P < 0.01) associated with weighted average steady-state dasatinib plasma concentrations, and pleural effusion was significantly associated with trough concentration. Major cytogenetic response was also significantly associated with maintenance of uninterrupted dosing. The 100 mg once daily arm had the lowest steady-state trough concentration of the four dose arms investigated in the Phase III study, and although this arm also had the lowest weighted average steady-state dasatinib plasma concentration, it had the highest dose maintenance.

Although dasatinib is the first-line treatment for CML, it has inhibitory activity against CYP3A4; this might increase the blood concentration of tacrolimus (administered to KT patients for immune suppression). Furthermore, tacrolimus can also increase blood concentrations of dasatinib through P-glycoprotein inhibition. Methods: Here, we report a case of sustained molecular remission of CML with prolonged first-line dasatinib therapy in a KT recipient being treated with tacrolimus. A 61-year-old woman developed CML-chronic phase (CML-CP) 38 months post KT. Her maintenance immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Considering the potential drug interaction with tacrolimus, dasatinib was administered at a low dose of 50 mg/day. Her immune status was evaluated regularly by assessing the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) using an intracellular carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeling technique; immunosuppressive therapy was adjusted accordingly. Results: The patient achieved complete hematologic remission (CHR) after 1 month of dasatinib treatment. Six months after dasatinib treatment, she achieved a major molecular response. During the observation period, neither antibody-mediated nor acute cellular rejection were encountered in the patient. She remained in CHR with a major molecular response 12 months after the diagnosis of CML-CP. Conclusion: Data obtained from immune monitoring assays using CFSE-MLR helped us to successfully manage a KT recipient with CML-CP being treated with dasatinib.

Dasatinib and LCB 03-0110 are small molecule multityrosine kinase inhibitors, and they share remarkably similar target kinases such as the c-Src family, Btk and Syk, which play key roles in the cell signalling of T cells and other inflammatory cells. Objectives: To test the anti-ACD activity of dasatinib and LCB 03-0110 and compare it with that of tacrolimus (FK506) and triamcinolone acetonide (a glucocorticoid), which are widely used for topical treatment of ACD, and to examine the two compounds for their capacity to induce skin atrophy, a side-effect. Methods: ACD was induced on the ears of mice by repeated topical application of oxazolone. Each test compound was then topically applied on the ear. Ear swelling, epidermal thickness and levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured. The skin atrophy induced by the compounds was tested during prolonged application on the dorsal skin of hairless mice, followed by haematoxylin and eosin staining.

Once-daily dosing regimens for dasatinib in the first and later lines of treatment were established through long-term (5-year and 7-year) trials. Recently published data have indicated that further dose optimization may maintain efficacy while minimizing adverse events. Results obtained from dose optimization and discontinuation trials currently in progress will help practitioners determine the best dose and duration of dasatinib for patients with CML, because treatment decisions will be made through continued discussions between physicians and patients.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data of CML-CP patients who received domestic dasatinib as second-line treatment in the CML collaborative group hospitals of Hubei province from March 2016 to July 2018 was performed. The optimal response rate, the cumulative complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), the cumulative major molecular responses (MMR), progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS) and adverse effects (AEs) of the patients were assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Results: A total of 83 CML-CP patients were enrolled in this study. The median follow-up time was 23 months. The optimal response rates at 3, 6 and 12 months in 83 CML-CP patients treated with dasatinib were 77.5% (54/71), 72.6% (61/75) and 60.7% (51/69), respectively. By the end of follow-up, the cumulative CCyR and MMR rates were 65.5% (55/80) and 57.1% (48/73), respectively. The median time to achieving CCyR and MMR was 3 months. During follow-up time, the PFS rate was 94.0% (79/83) and the EFS rate was 77.4% (65/83). The most common non-hematological AEs of dasatinib were edema (32.5%), rash itching (18.1%) and fatigue (13.3%). The common hematological AEs of dasatinib were thrombocytopenia (31.3%), leukopenia (19.3%) and anemia (6.0%).

Dasatinib is â325-fold more active than imatinib in inhibiting wild-type BCR-ABL kinase in vitro and is active against a wide variety of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants, except for T315I. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of dasatinib in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL, as well as summarizing its pharmacologic properties. In clinical trials, oral dasatinib was effective in achieving major or complete cytogenetic responses in both newly diagnosed and imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic-phase CML. Dasatinib was likewise effective in achieving major or overall hematologic responses in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant, accelerated- or blast-phase CML, or Ph+ ALL. Responses were rapidly achieved within 1-3 months and were durable over 1-5 years of follow-up. The majority of adverse events with dasatinib were of mild or moderate severity. Fluid retention (including pleural effusion) was the most common adverse event. Hematologic abnormalities were common and cytopenias were the most common grade 3/4 adverse events. Dasatinib 100 mg administered once daily was as effective as dasatinib 70 mg administered twice daily, and was better tolerated, being associated with lower incidences of pleural effusion and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, in particular. Dasatinib was more effective than high-dose imatinib in the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic-phase CML and was more effective than standard dosages of imatinib, as well as being associated with less frequent fluid retention, in patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. Dasatinib was generally equally effective in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations at baseline. Therefore, oral dasatinib is a highly effective, once-daily therapy for the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase CML, as well as for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic- and advanced-phase CML or Ph+ ALL.", relevance: "0.75"},

Even at a dose of 80 mg once daily, several patients may require further dose reductions due to substantial toxicity while maintaining good control of their disease. We report two CP-CML patients achieving and maintaining major molecular responses while on very low doses of dasatinib, ultimately achieving undetectable levels of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in their peripheral blood. Observations of several CP-CML cases responding remarkably well to dasatinib despite very low dose and frequent dose interruptions challenge our current understanding and the accuracy of the data regarding the optimum dose and schedule of this drug.

We examined whether dasatinib, a multi kinase inhibitor, which is broadly used for chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia is effective on EBV-positive B cell malignancies, using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro and in vivo. As a result, in vitro experiments showed that dasatinib induced cell death of the EBV-LCLs which was not accompanied with a lytic reactivation of EBVs. To evaluate the effectiveness in EBV latency type III represented by immunodeficiency lymphoma, LCL-inoculated immunodeficient NOD/shi-scid/Il2rgnul (NOG) mice were treated with dasatinib. However, in vivo experiments revealed that dasatinib treatment exacerbated tumor cell infiltration into the spleen of LCL-inoculated NOG mice, whereas tumor size at the inoculated site was not affected by the treatment. These results suggest that dasatinib exacerbates the pathogenesis at least in some situations although the drug is effective in vitro.

Objective: To determine whether dasatinib given at a daily dosage of 80 mg/m2 is more effective than imatinib mesylate at a daily dosage of 300 mg/m2 to improve event-free survival of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL in the context of intensive chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Design, setting, and participants: This open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 20 hospitals in China. Enrollment occurred from January 1, 2015, through September 18, 2018, and randomization was stopped on October 4, 2018, when the early stopping criterion of the trial was met. Patients aged 0 to 18 years were recruited. Of the 225 patients with the diagnosis, 35 declined participation and 1 died before treatment, leaving 189 patients available for analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1 through August 4, 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive daily dasatinib (n = 92) or imatinib (n = 97) continuously for the entire duration of ALL therapy from the time of diagnosis made during remission induction to the end of continuation therapy. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was event-free survival, analyzed based on intention to treat. The secondary outcomes were relapse, death due to toxic effects, and overall survival. Results: Among the 189 participants (136 male [72.0%]; median age, 7.8 [interquartile range (IQR), 5.2-11.3] years) and a median follow-up of 26.4 (IQR, 16.3-34.1) months, the 4-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 71.0% (95% CI, 56.2%-89.6%) and 88.4% (95% CI, 81.3%-96.1%), respectively, in the dasatinib group and 48.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-74.5%; P = .005, log-rank test) and 69.2% (95% CI, 55.6%-86.2%; P = .04, log-rank test), respectively, in the imatinib group. The 4-year cumulative risk of any relapse was 19.8% (95% CI, 4.2%-35.4%) in the dasatinib group and 34.4% (95% CI, 15.6%-53.2%) in the imatinib group (P = .01, Gray test), whereas the 4-year cumulative risk of an isolated central nervous system relapse was 2.7% (95% CI, 0.0%-8.1%) in the dasatinib group and 8.4% (95% CI, 1.2%-15.6%) in the imatinib group (P = .06, Gray test). There were no significant differences in the frequency of severe toxic effects between the 2 treatment groups. Conclusions and relevance: Intensive chemotherapy including dasatinib at a dosage of 80 mg/m2 per day yielded superior results in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL compared with imatinib mesylate at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 per day and provided excellent control of central nervous system leukemia without the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation.

Methods: This study was a standard phase I 3 + 3 dose escalation study evaluating two combination regimens, GD and GDC. Patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in cohorts of 3-6 to either GD or GDC. Gemcitabine was dosed at 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4 weeks, dasatinib was dosed in mg PO BID, and cetuximab was dosed at 250 mg/m2 weekly after a loading dose of cetuximab of 400 mg/m2. There were two dose levels for dasatinib: (1) gemcitabine + dasatinib 50 mg Â± cetuximab, and (2) gemcitabine + dasatinib 70 mg Â± cetuximab. Cycle length was 28 days. Standard cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) definitions were used. Eligible patients had advanced solid tumors, adequate organ and marrow function, and no co-morbidities that would increase the risk of toxicity. Serum, plasma, and skin biopsy biomarkers were obtained pre- and on-treatment. Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, including 21 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Three patients received prior gemcitabine. Twenty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity and 16 for response. Four DLTs were observed: Grade (Gr) 3 neutropenia (GDC1, n = 1), Gr 3 ALT (GD2, n = 2), and Gr 5 pneumonitis (GDC2, n = 1). Possible treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in later cycles included: Gr 3-4 neutropenia (n = 7), Gr 4 colitis (n = 1), Gr 3 bilirubin (n = 2), Gr 3 anemia (n = 2), Gr 3 thrombocytopenia (n = 2), Gr 3 edema/fluid retention (n = 1), and Gr 3 vomiting (n = 3). Six of 16 patients (3 of whom were gemcitabine-refractory) had stable disease (SD) as best response, median duration = 5 months (range 1-7). One gemcitabine-refractory patient had a partial response (PR). Median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.1, 5.8). Median OS was 5.8 months (95% CI 4.1, 11.8). Dermal wound biopsies demonstrated that dasatinib resulted in a decrease of total and phospho-Src levels, and cetuximab resulted in a decrease of EGFR and ERBB2 levels. Conclusions: The MTD/RPTD of GD is gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4 weeks and dasatinib 50 mg PO BID.

Methods: The incidence of lymphocytosis and its association with response, survival, and side effects were assessed in patients from 3 large clinical trials. Overall, 1402 dasatinib-treated patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP), CML-CP refractory/intolerant to imatinib, or with CML in accelerated or myeloid-blast phase were analyzed. Results: Lymphocytosis developed in 32% to 35% of patients and persisted for >12 months. This was not observed in the patients who received treatment with imatinib. Dasatinib-treated patients in all stages of CML who developed lymphocytosis were more likely to achieve a complete cytogenetic response, and patients who had CML-CP with lymphocytosis were more likely to achieve major and deep molecular responses. Progression-free and overall survival rates were significantly longer in patients with CML-CP who were refractory to or intolerant of imatinib and had lymphocytosis. Pleural effusions developed more commonly in patients with lymphocytosis. Conclusions: Overall, lymphocytosis occurred and persisted in many dasatinib-treated patients in all phases of CML.

Methods: In the present study, we attempted to investigate whether switching the treatment from imatinib to dasatinib can induce DMR in 16 CP-CML patients treated with imatinib for at least two years who achieved a major molecular response (MMR) with detectable levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Results: The rates of achievement of DMR at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after switching to dasatinib treatment in the 16 patients were 44% (7/16), 56% (9/16), 63% (10/16) and 75% (12/16), respectively. The cumulative rate of achieving DMR at 12 months from initiation of dasatinib therapy was 93.8% (15/16). The proportion of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells in peripheral lymphocytes increased after switching to dasatinib. In contrast, the proportion of regulatory T cells decreased during treatment. The safety profile of dasatinib was consistent with previous studies.

Although very effective, patients taking dasatinib often display severe adverse effects, including pleural effusions and increased risk of bleeding primarily in the gastrointestinal tract. The actual causes of these side effects are currently undetermined. We hypothesize that endothelial cells (ECs) that line the inner walls of blood vessels and control the traffic to the underlying tissues might be involved.Experimental Design: The effects of TKIs on ECs were studied by various assays, such as real-time cell impedance measurements, live-cell microscopy, wound healing, Western blot, and an in vivo model.Results: Dasatinib uniquely causes a profound, dose-dependent disorganization of the EC monolayers. Dasatinib promoted the disassembly of cell-cell contacts, altered cell-matrix contacts, and further altered the wound healing. A key observation is that this effect is fully reversible after drug washout. In line with these in vitro observations, intraperitoneal administration of dasatinib to mice caused significant vascular leakage in the intestine. The underlying molecular mechanism of dasatinib-induced reorganization of the actin involves ROCK activation, which increases the amount of the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and consequently activates the non-muscle myosin II.Conclusions: Our data are consistent with a scenario in which dasatinib triggers a transient increase in vascular leakage that probably contributes to adverse effects such as bleeding diathesis and pleural effusions.

Stage II accrued only KIT+ tumors (n = 30). To enrich the trial for KIT+ tumors, vulvovaginal melanoma was added, and CSD melanoma was removed from eligibility. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: From May 2009 to December 2010, the first stage enrolled 57 patients. Among the evaluable patients, 3 of 51 (5.9%) achieved a partial response: all were KIT-. Stage II closed early because of slow accrual (November 2011 to December 2015). In stage II, 4 of 22 evaluable patients (18.2%) had a partial response; the median duration was 4.2 months. The median PFS was 2.1 months (n = 73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.9 months). The median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.0-11.9 months). In exploratory analyses, no differences were seen in PFS or OS with the KIT status or subtype. Dasatinib was discontinued because of adverse events in 9 of 75 patients (12%). Conclusions: The dasatinib response rate among KIT+ melanoma patients was low. In view of its clinical activity, it is recommended that imatinib remain the KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor of choice for unresectable KIT+ melanoma. Cancer 2017;123:2688-97.

Given the importance of SFK signaling in cancer, known cooperation between SFK and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, and efficacy of EGFR inhibitors, we performed a phase I trial combining dasatinib, an SFK and multikinase inhibitor, with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients and methods: Patients received erlotinib for 1 week before addition of dasatinib; pharmacokinetics were performed after weeks 1 and 2. Four cohorts were examined, including twice-daily and daily dasatinib dosing. Responses were assessed after 8 weeks. Plasma levels of angiogenic markers (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], interleukin-8, and basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) were determined before and during treatment. Results: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. The average duration of treatment was 73 days. The main adverse events include GI (diarrhea, anorexia, and nausea), skin rash, cytopenias, pleural effusions, and fatigue. No effect of escalating doses of dasatinib was observed on erlotinib pharmacokinetics. Two partial responses and one bone response were observed, and the disease control rate was 63%. Reductions in plasma VEGF and bFGF were observed, and reductions in VEGF correlated with disease control. Conclusion: The combination of erlotinib and dasatinib is tolerable, with adverse effects consistent with the two agents. Disease control and inhibition of plasma angiogenesis markers were observed.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of discontinuing second-line or subsequent dasatinib after at least 1 year of deep molecular response. Methods: The Dasatinib Discontinuation trial was a prospective multicentre trial done in Japan. Eligible patients taking dasatinib and with confirmed stable deep molecular response were enrolled between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012. All patients received dasatinib consolidation therapy for at least 1 year. In those with sustained deep molecular response, dasatinib was discontinued. Patients were followed up every month in year 1 (clinical cutoff), every 3 months in year 2, and every 6 months in year 3 for deep molecular response and immunological profiles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment-free remission at 6 months after discontinuation. Molecular relapse was defined as loss of deep molecular response at any assessment. This study is registered, number UMIN000005130. Findings: 88 patients were enrolled in the consolidation phase, 24 were excluded from the discontinuation phase due to fluctuations in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. One patient was excluded because of positive expression of major and minor BCR-ABL1 transcripts in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells and the detection of minor BCR-ABL1 transcripts during consolidation. Thus, 63 patients discontinued dasatinib treatment. The 25 patients who were excluded from discontinuation continued to receive dasatinib and none showed disease progression. Median follow-up was 20.0 months (IQR 16.5-24.0). Of the 63 patients who discontinued and were not excluded, 30 patients maintained deep molecular response while 33 patients had molecular relapses, all within the first 7 months after discontinuation.

COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts.

Methods: Two large retrospective claims databases (01/1999-06/2009) were combined to identify CML patients (ICD-9 code 205.1x) who received one or more prescriptions of dasatinib or nilotinib. Studied patients had continuous enrollment â¥ 1 month prior to and after the index date, defined as the first prescription for dasatinib or nilotinib. Patients were followed for up to 6 months from the index date to the earliest of the termination of healthcare plan enrollment or end of data availability. Patients with bone marrow or stem cell transplant during the study period were excluded. Poisson regression models were used to compare healthcare resource utilization between the two groups. Results were reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR). Healthcare cost differences were estimated for each cost component using generalized linear models or two-part models. Treatment adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and compared using generalized linear models. Multivariate regressions were used to control for potential confounding factors. Results: A total of 521 CML patients receiving second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (452 dasatinib and 69 nilotinib) were studied. During the study period, dasatinib patients were estimated to have more than twice as many inpatient days (IRR = 2.44; p < 0.001) and nearly double the number of inpatient admissions (IRR = 1.99; p = 0.047) compared to nilotinib patients. Over the follow-up period, dasatinib patients incurred $8828 more in total medical service costs (p < 0.001); cost differences were mainly driven by an adjusted inpatient cost difference of $8520 (p = 0.003). Dasatinib patients were less adherent, with a PDC value approximately 13% lower compared to nilotinib patients (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Among CML patients treated with second-line TKIs, nilotinib patients were more adherent and experienced lower healthcare resource utilization, resulting in medical service cost savings compared to dasatinib patients.", relevance: "0.72"},

Notable side effects include pleural effusions and myelosuppression. Dasatinib at 50 mg daily has previously been reported to be active and better tolerated than the approved 100-mg daily dose. The aim of this study was to update the long-term follow-up results of dasatinib at 50 mg daily as frontline therapy for CML-CP. Methods: Eighty-three patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP received dasatinib at 50 mg daily. Eligibility and response criteria were standards used in previous protocols. Results: After a minimum follow-up of 12 months, 81 patients were evaluable. Two patients came off the study in less than 3 months. The rates of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels (International Standard) at â¤10% and â¤1% at 3 months were 96% and 77%, respectively. The cumulative rates for a complete cytogenetic response by 6 and 12 months were 77% and 95%, respectively. The cumulative rates for a major molecular response, a molecular response with a 4.0-log reduction, and a molecular response with a 4.5-log reduction by 12 months were 81%, 55%, and 49%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (25%) had treatment interruptions for a median of 13 days (range, 4-64 days). Five patients (6%) developed pleural effusions; 4 of these patients (80%) required a dose reduction. Two patients (2%) failed to achieve any cytogenetic or molecular response and were taken off the study. At a median follow-up of 24 months, none of the patients had disease transformation to an accelerated or blastic phase. The 2-year event-free and overall survival rates were 100%.

Resveratrol (Rsv) and quercetin (Quer), two natural polyphenols, are able to induce senescence in different cancer models, including gliomas, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. These polyphenols modulate the activity of several proteins involved in cell growth and death in cancer cells, including histone deacetylases (HDAC), but the role of HDAC in senescence induced by Rsv and Quer is unclear. The HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) potentiated the pro-senescent effect of Rsv and Quer in human and rat glioma cell lines but not in normal rat astrocytes. Furthermore, the increment of Quer-induced senescence by NaB was accompanied by an increase of reactive oxygen species levels and an increment of the number of cells with nuclear abnormalities.

We identified a significant increase in percentage of TBA in postdasatinib BM (P = .022). This suggests that dasatinib therapy can increase TBA without significant changes in bone and mineral metabolism. Interferences with bone homeostasis and mineral metabolism have been described in patients receiving imatinib for CML or gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Dasatinib is a potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit ABL and SRC kinases while also interfering with the c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and STAT5 pathways. Patients and methods: We used a multiparameter approach to examine the off-target effects of dasatinib in 30 patients with CML treated between 2009 and 2012. We recorded serum Ca and PO4 levels, analyzed markers of bone formation (bone alkaline phosphatase/bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP]) and bone resorption (NTx), measured OPG levels, and digitally analyzed changes in TBA in paired BM biopsy specimens before and after treatment. We correlated all findings with each other and with the results of conventional cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Results: We identified a significant increase in the percentage of TBA in postdasatinib BM biopsy specimens (P = .022) and noted a decrease in serum OPG levels in 75% of patients. Ca, PO4, BAP, and NTx levels remained steady, without significant changes. There was no correlation between biomarker levels, percentage of TBA, and/or cytogenetic or molecular response. Conclusion: These findings suggest that dasatinib therapy (within the therapeutic range) can increase trabecular bone, without causing significant changes in bone and mineral metabolism.

Preclinical data have indicated that dasatinib is metabolized primarily through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and may cause QT prolongation. In light of its improved tolerability, the authors were interested in the safety of a once-daily dasatinib regimen. Methods: The authors conducted a phase 1 trial of dasatinib in 29 patients with advanced solid tumors. Segment 1 of the trial was short term and sequential and was designed to determine whether the coadministration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had an effect on the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib. Segment 2 was designed to evaluate the safety of dasatinib as dosing was increased. QT intervals were monitored closely in both segments. Efficacy was assessed in Segment 2 using both positron emission tomography and computed tomography. Results: Hematologic toxicities were markedly less than those observed in patients with leukemia, whereas nonhematologic toxicities were similar. The authors determined that the maximum recommended dose was 180 mg once daily based on the incidence of pleural effusion. Coadministration of ketoconazole led to a marked increase in dasatinib exposure, which was correlated with an increase in corrected QT (QTc) values of approximately 6 msec. No adverse cardiac events were observed. Conclusions: The dose-limiting toxic effect for dasatinib was pleural effusion.

The Src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib has been found to effectively block bevacizumab-induced glioma invasion in preclinical models, which led to the hypothesis that combining bevacizumab with dasatinib could increase bevacizumab efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM. Methods: After the completion of the phase 1 component, the phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00892177) randomized patients with recurrent GBM 2:1 to receive 100 mg of oral dasatinib twice daily (arm A) or placebo (arm B) on days 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle combined with 10 mg/kg of intravenous bevacizumab on day 1 of each 14-day cycle.

Methods: Patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC after platinum-based therapy were treated with dasatinib either orally or via percutaneous feeding gastrostomy (PFG). Primary endpoints were 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate with a 2-stage design and early withdrawal if the 12-week PFS rate was â¤20% and no patients had an objective response (OR). Forty-nine serum cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) were analyzed from treated patients.

With the prevalent use of imatinib worldwide, it was observed that up to one-third of patients are resistant to or intolerant of imatinib therapy, fueling the search for safer and more effective agents. The newer and more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib were first indicated for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/-intolerant patients, for whom these agents are both safe and efficacious. More recent clinical studies have examined nilotinib and dasatinib in the frontline setting in newly diagnosed patients. Data reported from the phase III ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients) study and the DASISION (Dasatinib versus Imatinib in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Chronic-phase CML) trial support the use of nilotinib and dasatinib as potential new standards for frontline care of newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase. Furthermore, both agents have received regulatory approval for use as frontline agents. These agents have demonstrated significantly superior efficacy compared with imatinib, as measured by complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response rates. In addition, progression to advanced disease was significantly lower for nilotinib, and a trend toward lower progression was observed with dasatinib. Although both nilotinib and dasatinib are generally well tolerated in the frontline setting, they have different safety profiles that may affect their selection as treatment.

The study investigated pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses of dasatinib in 51 newly diagnosed, chronic phase, chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Methods: The dasatinib concentration required to inhibit 50 % of the CrkL (CT10 regulator of kinase like) phosphorylation in bone marrow CD34+ cells (half maximal (50 %) inhibitory concentration (IC50)CD34+cells) was calculated from each patients dose-response curve using flow cytometry. PK parameters were obtained from the population pharmacokinetic analysis of dasatinib concentrations in plasma on day 28 after administration. Results: Early molecular responses were not significantly associated with PK or PD (IC50 CD34+cells) parameters. However, the PK/PD parameter-time above IC50 CD34+cells-significantly correlated with BCR-ABL transcript level at 3 months (correlation coefficient (CC) = -0.292, P = 0.0375) and the reduction of BCR-ABL level at 1 or 3 months (CC = -0.404, P = 0.00328 and CC = -0.356, P = 0.0104, respectively).

Objective: This technology assessment reviews the available evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dasatinib, nilotinib and standard-dose imatinib for the first-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. Data sources: Databases [including MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, the US Food and Drug Administration website and the European Medicines Agency website] were searched from search end date of the last technology appraisal report on this topic in October 2002 to September 2011. Review methods: A systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies; a review of surrogate relationships with survival; a review and critique of manufacturer submissions; and a model-based economic analysis. Results: Two clinical trials (dasatinib vs imatinib and nilotinib vs imatinib) were included in the effectiveness review. Survival was not significantly different for dasatinib or nilotinib compared with imatinib with the 24-month follow-up data available. The rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were higher for patients receiving dasatinib than for those with imatinib for 12 months follow-up (CCyR 83% vs 72%, p < 0.001; MMR 46% vs 28%, p < 0.0001). The rates of CCyR and MMR were higher for patients receiving nilotinib than for those receiving imatinib for 12 months follow-up (CCyR 80% vs 65%, p < 0.001; MMR 44% vs 22%, p < 0.0001). An indirect comparison analysis showed no difference between dasatinib and nilotinib for CCyR or MMR rates for 12 months follow-up (CCyR, odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.92; MMR, odds ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.16). There is observational association evidence from imatinib studies supporting the use of CCyR and MMR at 12 months as surrogates for overall all-cause survival and progression-free survival in patients with CML in chronic phase. In the cost-effectiveness modelling scenario, analyses were provided to reflect the extensive structural uncertainty and different approaches to estimating OS. First-line dasatinib is predicted to provide very poor value for money compared with first-line imatinib, with deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of between Â£256,000 and Â£450,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Conversely, first-line nilotinib provided favourable ICERs at the willingness-to-pay threshold of Â£20,000-30,000 per QALY. Limitations: Immaturity of empirical trial data relative to life expectancy, forcing either reliance on surrogate relationships or cumulative survival/treatment duration assumptions. Conclusions: From the two trials available, dasatinib and nilotinib have a statistically significant advantage compared with imatinib as measured by MMR or CCyR. Taking into account the treatment pathways for patients with CML, i.e. assuming the use of second-line nilotinib, first-line nilotinib appears to be more cost-effective than first-line imatinib. Dasatinib was not cost-effective if decision thresholds of Â£20,000 per QALY or Â£30,000 per QALY were used, compared with imatinib and nilotinib. Uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis would be substantially reduced with better and more UK-specific data on the incidence and cost of stem cell transplantation in patients with chronic CML.

Methods: A phase 2, open-label study was initiated of 150 patients with imatinib-resistant CP-CML who were randomized (2:1) to receive either dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (n=101) or high-dose imatinib 800 mg (400 mg twice daily; n=49). Results: At a minimum follow-up of 2 years, dasatinib demonstrated higher rates of complete hematologic response (93% vs 82%; P=.034), major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (53% vs 33%; P=.017), and complete cytogenetic response (44% vs 18%; P=.0025).

However, it is difficult to use in vitro dissolution results to predict in vivo dissolution, particularly the pH-dependent solubility of weak acid and base drugs, because the USP apparatus contains one vessel with a fixed pH for the test drug, limiting insight into in vivo drug dissolution of weak acid and weak base drugs. This discrepancy underscores the need to develop new in vitro dissolution methodology that better predicts in vivo response to assure the therapeutic efficacy and safety of oral drug products. Thus, the development of the in vivo predictive dissolution (IPD) methodology is necessitated. The major goals of in vitro dissolution are to ensure the performance of oral drug products and the support of drug formulation design, including bioequivalence (BE). Orally administered anticancer drugs, such as dasatinib and erlotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), are used to treat various types of cancer. These drugs are weak bases that exhibit pH-dependent and high solubility in the acidic stomach and low solubility in the small intestine (>pH 6.0). Therefore, these drugs supersaturate and/or precipitate when they move from the stomach to the small intestine. Also of importance, gastric acidity for cancer patients may be altered with aging (reduction of gastric fluid secretion) and/or co-administration of acid-reducing agents. These may result in changes to the dissolution profiles of weak base and the reduction of drug absorption and efficacy. In vitro dissolution methodologies that assess the impact of these physiological changes in the GI condition are expected to better predict in vivo dissolution of oral medications for patients and, hence, better assess efficacy, toxicity and safety concerns. The objective of this present study is to determine the initial conditions for a mini-Gastrointestinal Simulator (mGIS) to assess in vivo dissolution of BCS class IIb drugs, dasatinib as a model drug, including the different gastric condition. The maximum dissolution of dasatinib with USP dissolution apparatus II was less than 1% in pH 6.5 SIF, while the one with mGIS (pH 1.2 SGF/pH 6.5 SIF) reached almost 100%. The supersaturation and precipitation of dasatinib were observed in the in vitro dissolution studies with mGIS but not with USP apparatus II. Additionally, dasatinib dissolution with mGIS was reduced to less than 10% when the gastric pH was elevated, suggesting the co-administration of acid reducing agents will decrease the oral bioavailability of dasatinib. Accurate prediction of in vivo drug dissolution would be beneficial for assuring product safety and efficacy for patients. To this end, we have created a new in vitro dissolution system, mGIS, to predict the in vivo dissolution phenomena of a weak base drug, dasatinib. The experimental results when combined with in silico simulation suggest that the mGIS predicted the in vivo dissolution well due to the elevation of gastric pH. Thus, mGIS might be suitable to predict in vivo dissolution of weak basic drugs. This mGIS methodology is expected to significantly advance the prediction of in vivo drug dissolution. It is also expected to assist in optimizing product development and drug formulation design in support of Quality by Design (QbD) initiatives.", relevance: "0.69"},

Use of dasatinib is frequently complicated by pleural effusions. This review highlights the risk factors for development of effusions as well as characteristics of the pleural fluid. Potential mechanisms involved and a set of management recommendations based on available evidence are also discussed. Recent findings: The incidence of dasatinib-associated pleural effusions is approximately 20%. A twice-daily dosing regimen was found to significantly correlate with development of effusions, and therefore once-daily dosing is now approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dasatinib-associated pleural effusions are generally lymphocyte-predominant exudates. The mechanism of occurrence is unknown but may involve an immune-mediated pathway or off-target inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide. Management typically involves dose interruption or reduction, diuretics and short-term corticosteroid therapy. Summary: Dasatinib is a promising agent for the treatment of refractory chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its use can be complicated by development of exudative pleural effusions of unclear etiology. Incidence is decreasing with once-daily dosing, but when effusions do occur, most can be managed with specific measures without necessitating discontinuation of therapy.", relevance: "0.69"},

We have analyzed the kinases targeted by dasatinib by using an unbiased chemical proteomics approach to detect binding proteins directly from lysates of CML cells. Besides Abl and Src kinases, we have identified the Tec kinases Btk and Tec, but not Itk, as major binders of dasatinib. The kinase activity of Btk and Tec, but not of Itk, was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib in vitro and in cultured cells. We identified the gatekeeper residue as the critical determinant of dasatinib susceptibility. Mutation of Thr-474 in Btk to Ile and Thr-442 in Tec to Ile conferred resistance to dasatinib, whereas mutation of the corresponding residue in Itk (Phe-435) to Thr sensitized the otherwise insensitive Itk to dasatinib. The configuration of this residue may be a predictor for dasatinib sensitivity across the kinome. Analysis of mast cells derived from Btk-deficient mice suggested that inhibition of Btk by dasatinib may be responsible for the observed reduction in histamine release upon dasatinib treatment. Furthermore, dasatinib inhibited histamine release in primary human basophils and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in immune cells.

Using a collection of 55 leukemia patients treated with TKI therapy (chronic myeloid leukemia, n=47; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n=8), we found that dasatinib, a second-generation broad-spectrum TKI, induced a rapid, dose-dependent and substantial mobilization of non-leukemic lymphocytes and monocytes in blood peaking 1-2 h after an oral intake and the blood counts closely mirrored drug plasma concentration. A preferential mobilization was observed for natural killer (NK), NK T, B and Î³Î´+ T cells. Mobilization was coupled with a more effective transmigration of leukocytes through an endothelial cell layer and improved cytotoxicity of NK cells. Platelet numbers decreased markedly after the drug intake in a proportion of patients. Similar effects on blood cell dynamics and function were not observed with any other TKI (imatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib).

Imatinib mesylate, a BCR-ABL TK inhibitor, is the frontline therapy for CML. Despite the stunning efficacy of this agent, a small number of patients develop a suboptimal response or resistance to imatinib. In newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML, the rate of resistance to imatinib at 4 years was up to 20%, increasing to 70% to 90% for patients in the accelerated/blastic phase. Resistance to imatinib led to the development of novel TK inhibitors such as dasatinib. Several clinical trials have reported more durable complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses with this agent in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib is well tolerated and has broad efficacy, resulting in durable responses in patients with any BCR-ABL mutation except for T3151 and mutations in codon 317 - most commonly F317L - including mutations that were highly resistant to imatinib, such as L248, Y253, E255, F359, and H396. Dasatinib is recommended for CML in chronic, blastic or accelerated phase that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib was approved by the FDA at 100 mg once daily as the starting dose in patients with chronic phase CML and at 70 mg twice daily in patients with accelerated or blastic phase CML. Various clinical trial results provided evidence that resistance to one TK inhibitor can be reversed with the use of a different TK inhibitor (TKI). Other second-generation TKIs with activity in CML include nilotinib, bosutinib and INNO 406.

In order to answer this question, the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of PE and lymphocytosis among our CML patients receiving second-line dasatinib, and to compare the responses and outcomes between patients with or without PE. There were 18 patients (44%) who developed PE, in a total of 41 patients, with a median time of 15 months.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is due to become the 3rd largest cause of mortality by 2030 and mortality from other respiratory conditions such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis are not reducing. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to address this problem as many of the current strategies targeting inflammation are not sufficient. The innate immune system of the lung is an important defence against invading pathogens, but in many chronic pulmonary diseases, this system mounts an inappropriate response. In COPD, macrophages are increased in number, but fail to clear pathogens correctly and become highly activated. This leads to increased damage and remodelling of the airways. In idiopathic fibrosis, there is a switch of macrophage phenotype to a cell that promotes abnormal repair. Neutrophils also display dysfunction in COPD where aberrant migratory profiles may lead to increased damage to lung tissue and emphysema; while in cystic fibrosis the proteolytic lung environment damages neutrophil receptors leading to ineffective phagocytosis and migration. Targeting the innate immune system to restore normal function could have enormous benefits. Improving phagocytosis of pathogens could reduce exacerbations and hence the associated decline in lung function, and novel therapeutics such as sulforaphane appear to do this in vitro. Other natural products such as resveratrol and derivatives also have anti-inflammatory properties. Statins have traditionally been used to manage cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemia, however these molecules also have beneficial effects on the innate immune cells. Statins have been shown to be anti-inflammatory and restore aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis in aged cells. Other possible agents that may be efficacious are senolytics. These compounds include natural products such as quercetin which have anti-inflammatory properties but can also suppress viral replication. As viruses have been shown to suppress phagocytosis of macrophages, it is possible that these compounds could have benefit during viral exacerbations to protect this innate response. These compounds demonstrate that it is possible to address defective innate responses in the lung but a better understanding of the mechanisms driving defective innate immunity in pulmonary disease may lead to improved therapeutics.", relevance: "0.68"},

Imatinib mesylate, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (TKIs) is the most prominent example of this new era and has opened the way to the development of several additional TKIs, including sunitinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, sorafenib and lapatinib, in the treatment of various hematological malignancies and solid tumors. All these agents are characterized by an important inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability, are at risk for drug interactions, and are not devoid of toxicity. Additionally, they are administered for prolonged periods, anticipating the careful monitoring of their plasma exposure via Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) to be an important component of patients follow-up. We have developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) requiring 100 microL of plasma for the simultaneous determination of the six major TKIs currently in use. Plasma is purified by protein precipitation and the supernatant is diluted in ammonium formate 20 mM (pH 4.0) 1:2. Reverse-phase chromatographic separation of TKIs is obtained using a gradient elution of 20 mM ammonium formate pH 2.2 and acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid, followed by rinsing and re-equilibration to the initial solvent composition up to 20 min. Analyte quantification, using matrix-matched calibration samples, is performed by electro-spray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring detection using the positive mode. The method was validated according to FDA recommendations, including assessment of extraction yield, matrix effects variability (<9.6%), overall process efficiency (87.1-104.2%), as well as TKIs short- and long-term stability in plasma. The method is precise (inter-day CV%: 1.3-9.4%), accurate (-9.2 to +9.9%) and sensitive (lower limits of quantification comprised between 1 and 10 ng/mL). This is the first broad-range LC-MS/MS assay covering the major currently in-use TKIs. It is an improvement over previous methods in terms of convenience (a single extraction procedure for six major TKIs, reducing significantly the analytical time), sensitivity, selectivity and throughput. It may contribute to filling the current knowledge gaps in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationships of the latest TKIs developed after imatinib and better define their therapeutic ranges in different patient populations in order to evaluate whether a systematic TDM-guided dose adjustment of these anticancer drugs could contribute to minimize the risk of major adverse reactions and to increase the probability of efficient, long lasting, therapeutic response.", relevance: "0.67"},

Because continuous and adequate dosing is important to achieve this outcome, it is important to understand treatment adherence as part of managing long-term CML therapy. While studies regarding imatinib suggest that adherence varies widely, data addressing adherence to newer breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) are sparse. This study evaluates real-world adherence in patients diagnosed with CML receiving dasatinib or nilotinib as second-line therapy. Research design and methods: Using the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD(SM)), patients with â¥1 International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition/revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for CML (205.1x ) and â¥1 prescription for imatinib from January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2010 were identified. Analysis was limited to patients who switched to second-line dasatinib or nilotinib. Dasatinib exposure was stratified by dose (â¤100 mg/day or â¥140 mg/day) to account for dasatinib label changes. Main outcome measures: Medication possession ratio (MPR) was used to calculate adherence and Cox proportional hazard models were used to quantify poor rates of adherence (i.e., MPR <85%). Results: Of 2064 imatinib-exposed patients, 197 received dasatinib (â¤100 mg/day, n = 112; â¥140 mg/day, n = 85) and 53 received nilotinib (400 mg BID, n = 46; 400 mg QD, n = 7) as second-line therapy. Mean exposure durations were 276 days for dasatinib (â¤100 mg, 275 days; â¥140 mg, 276 days) and 170 days for nilotinib. Cox proportional hazard models quantifying rates of poor adherence (MPR < 85%) comparing nilotinib with dasatinib (adjusted for age, sex, duration of previous imatinib exposure, number of concomitant medications, presence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes) calculated hazard ratios of 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.4) for nilotinib versus dasatinib overall, 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) for nilotinib versus dasatinib â¤100 mg, and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.0) for nilotinib versus dasatinib â¥140 mg. Conclusions: While this study is limited by use of claims data to identify CML and adherence, claims based data have been widely used to evaluate the association between treatment use and clinical outcomes. When stratified by dose, patients receiving second-line nilotinib were almost two times more likely to have poor adherence compared with patients receiving second-line dasatinib at the current approved dose of 100 mg once daily.", relevance: "0.67"},

Dasatinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including Src kinases. Data suggests that dasatinib kinase inhibition leads to antitumour activity, affects osteoclasts, and has synergy with docetaxel, a first-line chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed whether dasatinib plus docetaxel in chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer led to greater efficacy than with docetaxel alone. Methods: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, we enrolled men of 18 years or older with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and adequate organ function from 186 centres across 25 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks, plus oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily), plus either dasatinib (100 mg orally once daily) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

To determine the utility of the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS) surveillance database for identifying AEs possibly associated with the BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in the postmarketing patient population, we conducted Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker disproportionality analyses of FAERS reports on AEs in relevant system organ classes. Signals consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents as well as signals for less well-described AEs were detected. Bone marrow necrosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, and peritoneal fluid retention events were uniquely associated with imatinib. AEs that most commonly reached the threshold for dasatinib consisted of terms relating to hemorrhage and fluid retention, including pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Most terms that reached the threshold solely with nilotinib were related to peripheral and cardiac vascular events. Although this type of analysis cannot determine AE incidence or establish causality, these findings elucidate the AEs reported in patients treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors across multiple clinical trials and in the community setting for all approved and nonapproved indications, suggesting drug-AE associations warrant further investigation.

Combination of electrophoretic mobility shift studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Sp1 overexpression experiments, as well as promoter mutagenesis identifies enhanced Sp1 binding to two GC-boxes at -238/-231 and -118/-106 as the core mechanism of oxidative stress-triggered caveolin-1 transactivation. In addition, signaling studies show p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as the upstream regulator of Sp1-mediated activation of the caveolin-1 promoter following oxidative stress. Inhibition of p38 MAPK prevents the oxidant-induced Sp1-mediated up-regulation of caveolin-1 protein expression and development of premature senescence. Finally, we show that oxidative stress induces p38-mediated up-regulation of caveolin-1 and premature senescence in normal human mammary epithelial cells but not in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which do not express caveolin-1 and undergo apoptosis. This study delineates for the first time the molecular mechanisms that modulate caveolin-1 gene transcription upon oxidative stress and brings new insights into the redox control of cellular senescence in both normal and cancer cells.", relevance: "0.65"},

Little is known about recurrent AOE and the role of secondary prevention in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) with previous AOE, treated with second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2ndG/3rdG TKIs), nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. Methods: We identified a real-life cohort of 57 consecutive adult CML patients treated with 2ndG/3rdG TKI. All patients had a previous history of AOE. Ongoing use of secondary prevention of AOE (including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant therapy, and statins) before starting a 2ndG/3rdG TKI was recorded, as well as CV risk factors. Results: The 60-month cumulative incidence rate of recurrent AOEs was 47.8 Â± 10.9%. Despite a history of AOE, 10 patients (16%) were not receiving secondary preventative measures. Patients treated with nilotinib and ponatinib showed a higher incidence of recurrent AOEs (76.7 Â± 14.3% and 64 Â± 20.1%, respectively) than those treated with dasatinib and bosutinib (44 Â± 24.2% and 30.5 Â± 15.5%, respectively) (p = 0.01).

Dasatinib is approved for treatment of adults and children with CML-CP. A phase I study determined suitable dosing for children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. Methods CA180-226/NCT00777036 is a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized prospective trial of patients < 18 years of age receiving dasatinib. There are three cohorts: (1) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP, (2) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML in accelerated/blast phase or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 17), and (3) newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with tablets or powder for oral suspension. Major cytogenetic response > 30% for imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) > 55% for newly diagnosed patients were of clinical interest. Results Of 113 patients with CML-CP, 14 (48%) who were imatinib-resistant/intolerant and 61 (73%) who were newly diagnosed remained on treatment at time of analysis. Major cytogenetic response > 30% was reached by 3 months in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and CCyR > 55% was reached by 6 months in the newly diagnosed CML-CP group. CCyR and major molecular response by 12 months, respectively, were 76% and 41% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and 92% and 52% in newly diagnosed CML-CP group. Progression-free survival by 48 months was 78% and 93% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant and newly diagnosed CML-CP groups, respectively. No dasatinib-related pleural or pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported. Bone growth and development events were reported in 4% of patients. Conclusion In the largest prospective trial to date in children with CML-CP, we demonstrate that dasatinib is a safe, effective treatment of pediatric CML-CP. Target responses to first- or second-line dasatinib were met early, and deep molecular responses were observed. Safety of dasatinib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults; however, no cases of pleural or pericardial effusion or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported.", relevance: "0.65"},

The resulting gene product, BCR-ABL, encodes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase (TK) that is a factor in the pathology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Use of targeted therapy that inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity may lead to hematologic and cytogenetic responses in affected individuals. The oral TK inhibitor dasatinib was approved in 2006 for use in patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are unable to tolerate or have not responded to other treatments. Objective: This paper reviews the available data on dasatinib, including its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, findings of in vitro and in vivo studies, adverse effects, and potential place in therapy. Methods: Pertinent information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2007), EMBASE (1980-first quarter 2007), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2007) using the terms dasatinib, BMS-354825, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Sprycel, Philadelphia chromosome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All clinical studies and case reports published at the time of the search were included in this review. Results: Observed mutations in the amino acid sequence of BCR-ABL cause the failure of treatment with existing TK inhibitors. Dasatinib has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against BCR-ABL, including mutations that are resistant to other available TK inhibitors. Preliminary results are available from several noncomparative studies of dasatinib in patients who were unable to tolerate or were resistant to previous therapies. The 5 phases of START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) represent the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of dasatinib in the treatment of patients in all stages of CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL who had undergone previous treatment for leukemia. Dasatanib had the greatest benefit in patients in the chronic phase of CML, with complete hematologic responses in 90% of patients, 52% of whom achieved a major hematologic response. Compared with those in the chronic phase, patients in the accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML, or with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had lower responses. In the START-R trial, which compared the response to dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (800 mg/d), both regimens had comparable ability to induce a complete hematologic response (95% and 93%, respectively), although more patients achieved a major cytogenetic response with dasatinib (32% vs 7%). Adverse effects include significant myelosuppression. Dasatinib may have the potential for use in the management of nonleukemic malignancies. Conclusions: Dasatinib has a wider spectrum of activity against a broader range of BCR-ABL forms than existing TK inhibitors. It has shown clinical benefit and tolerability in patients in all phases of CML, as well as in those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib illustrates the potential for targeted drug development based on an understanding of the genetic alterations leading to CML and the development of resistance to treatment.", relevance: "0.65"},

The pTCR/TCR signaling pathways play a critical role in cell fate decisions during physiological thymocyte development, with an interplay between TCR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling determining the T-lymphocyte selection process. We performed an shRNA screen in vitro and in vivo in T-ALL cell lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) samples to identify vulnerabilities in the pTCR/TCR pathway and identified a critical role for the kinase LCK in cell proliferation. LCK knockdown or inhibition with dasatinib (DAS) caused cell cycle arrest. Combination of DAS with dexamethasone (DEX) resulted in significant drug synergy leading to cell death. The efficacy of this drug combination was underscored in a randomized phase II-like murine trial, recapitulating an early phase human clinical trial. T-ALL expansion in immunocompromised mice was significantly impaired using this drug combination, relative to mice receiving control vehicle or single drug treatment, highlighting the immediate clinical relevance of this drug combination for high risk T-ALL patients.

ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, are currently the front-line treatment options for CML. Recently, natural killer (NK) cell activation and expansion have been shown to be associated with optimal treatment responses for CML. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of these TKIs on NK cells, here we characterized activating and inhibitory NK receptors in CD3-CD16+CD56dim NK cells isolated from CML patients in chronic phase (CP). The expressions of activating NK receptors, such as NKG2D, natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) and DNAM-1, rebounded after successful TKI treatments for CML. In contrast, among the three surveyed inhibitory receptors (NKG2A, KIR2DL1, and KIR3DL1), only the expression of NKG2A was reverted and suppressed to a very low level by dasatinib, and not by imatinib or nilotinib. CML patients treated with dasatinib indeed expressed fewer NKG2A+ NK cells, which send negative signals for induction of NK cytotoxicity. For these dasatinib-treated patients, the duration to reach major molecular response (MMR) was shorter, and significantly correlated with individuals NKG2A+ NK cell number. This clinical relevance to NKG2A was not observed in treatments with imatinib or nilotinib. In line with dasatinib-specific down-regulation of NKG2A, NK cytotoxicity evaluated by the killing assay was also significantly higher in patients treated with dasatinib than in those treated with imatinib or nilotinib. The lower NK cytotoxicity from imatinib or nilotinib treatments could be reverted by NKG2A blockade using anti-NKG2A antibody. Further in vitro experiments revealed mechanistically that dasatinib could inactivate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and consequently affect nuclear import of GATA-3 and GATA-3 transcriptional activities for NKG2A. Our results highlight the dual effects of dasatinib in direct inhibition of ABL kinase and in immunomodulation through NKG2A down-regulation, contributing to accelerated molecular responses (MR) in CML.", relevance: "0.64"},

These aggressive phenotypes are in part attributed to the presence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Therefore, targeting BCSCs is a priority to overcoming chemotherapy failure in TNBCs. Methods: We generated paclitaxel (pac)-resistant TNBC cells which displayed higher sphere forming potential and percentage of BCSC subpopulations compared to the parental cells. A screen with various kinase inhibitors revealed dasatinib, a Src kinase family inhibitor, as a potent suppressor of BCSC expansion/sphere formation in pac-resistant TNBC cells. Results: We found dasatinib to block pac-induced BCSC enrichment and Src activation in both parental and pac-resistant TNBC cells. Interestingly, dasatinib induced an epithelial differentiation of the pac-resistant mesenchymal cells, resulting in their enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel. The combination treatment of dasatinib and paclitaxel not only decreased the BCSCs numbers and their sphere forming capacity but also synergistically reduced cell viability of pac-resistant cells. Preclinical models of breast cancer further demonstrated the efficiency of the dasatinib/paclitaxel combination treatment in inhibiting tumour growth.

Results: In the first stage, 13 patients were evaluable for response: 7 had progressive and 6 had stable disease (SD). Enrollment was halted for futility, and biomarker analysis initiated. Low serum IL6 levels were associated with SD (raw p=0.028, adjusted p=0.14) and improved overall survival (p=0.010).

On a cellular level, aging results in an increase in cells that are in a permanent cell cycle arrest, termed senescence, which secrete a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Consequently, these senescent cells negatively influence the local milieu by causing inflammaging, and by reducing the regenerative capacity of the kidney. Moreover, the oxidative damage that is inflicted by ischemia-reperfusion injury during transplantation can induce senescence and accelerate aging. In this review, we describe recent developments in the understanding of the biology of aging that have led to the development of a new class of therapeutic agents aimed at eliminating senescent cells. These compounds have already shown to be able to restore tissue homeostasis in old mice, improve kidney function and general health- and lifespan. Use of these anti-senescence compounds holds great promise to improve the quality of marginal donor kidneys as well as to remove senescent cells induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury.

In the UK, an estimated 560 new cases of CML are diagnosed each year. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in the treatment of people with imatinib-resistant (ImR) and imatinib-intolerant (ImI) CML. A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature, a review of manufacturer submissions and a critique and exploration of manufacturer submissions for accelerated phase and blast crisis CML were carried out and a decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in chronic phase CML. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODS: Key databases were searched for relevant studies from their inception to June 2009 [MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), EMBASE, (ISI Web of Science) Conference Proceedings Citation Index and four others]. One reviewer assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, with a sample checked by a second reviewer. The full text of relevant papers was obtained and screened against the full inclusion criteria independently by two reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Clinical effectiveness studies were synthesised through narrative review. ECONOMIC EVALUATION METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses reported in manufacturer submissions to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence were critically appraised and summarised narratively. In addition, the models for accelerated phase and blast crisis underwent a more detailed critique and exploration. Two separate decision-analytic models were developed for chronic phase CML, one simulating a cohort of individuals who have shown or developed resistance to normal dose imatinib and one representing individuals who have been unable to continue imatinib treatment owing to adverse events. One-way, multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore structural and parameter uncertainty. Results: Fifteen studies were included in the systematic review. Chronic phase: effectiveness data were limited but dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic response and haematological response in both ImR and ImI populations. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it was extremely difficult to reach any conclusions regarding either agent in the ImR population. All three models (Novartis, PenTAG and Bristol-Myers Squibb) were seriously flawed in one way or another, as a consequence of the paucity of data appropriate to construct robust decision-analytic models. Accelerated and blast crisis: all available data originated from observational single-arm studies and there were considerable and potentially important differences in baseline characteristics which seriously undermined any process for making meaningful comparisons between treatments. Owing to a lack of available clinical data, de novo models of accelerated phase and blast crisis have not been developed. The economic evaluations carried out by the manufacturers of nilotinib and dasatinib were seriously undermined by the absence of evidence on high-dose imatinib in these populations. Limitations: The study has been necessarily constrained by the paucity of available clinical data, the differences in definitions used in the studies and the subsequent impossibility of undertaking a meaningful cost-effectiveness analyses to inform all policy questions. Conclusions: Dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic and haematological responses in both ImR and ImI populations. It was difficult to reach any cost-effectiveness conclusions as a consequence of the paucity of the data. Future research should include a three-way, double-blind, randomised clinical trial of dasatinib, nilotinib and high-dose imatinib.", relevance: "0.62"},

The progression of ageing correlates with the gradual accumulation of stressors and damaged biomolecules due to the time-dependent decline of stress resistance and functional capacity, which eventually compromise cellular homeodynamics. As protein machines carry out the majority of cellular functions, proteome quality control is critical for cellular functionality and is carried out through the curating activity of the proteostasis network (PN). Key components of the PN are the two main degradation machineries, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways along with several stress-responsive pathways, such as that of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which mobilises cytoprotective genomic responses against oxidative and/or xenobiotic damage. Reportedly, genetic or dietary interventions that activate components of the PN delay ageing in evolutionarily diverse organisms. Natural products (extracts or pure compounds) represent an extraordinary inventory of highly diverse structural scaffolds that offer promising activities towards meeting the challenge of increasing healthspan and/or delaying ageing (e.g., spermidine, quercetin or sulforaphane). Herein, we review those natural compounds that have been found to activate proteostatic and/or anti-stress cellular responses and hence have the potential to delay cellular senescence and/or in vivo ageing.", relevance: "0.62"},

Such VAEs include pulmonary hypertension in patients treated with dasatinib, peripheral arterial occlusive disease and other arterial disorders in patients receiving nilotinib, and venous and arterial vascular occlusive events during ponatinib.

It is approved at a dose of 100 mg orally daily for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). This dose schedule is associated with myelosuppression and pleural effusions. Anecdotal data suggest that lower doses may be as effective and less toxic. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a lower dose of dasatinib (50 mg daily) in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP. Methods: Seventy-five patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP received dasatinib 50 mg daily. The eligibility and response criteria were standards used in previous protocols. Results: At a median follow-up of 9 months, 60 patients were evaluable for a response at 3 months. The rates of patients achieving BCR-ABL1 transcript levels â¤ 10% and â¤ 1% at 3 months by the International Standard were 93% and 72%, respectively. The rates of complete cytogenetic response by conventional cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization at 6 and 12 months were 86% and 88%, respectively. At 12 months, 79%, 71%, and 46% of the patients had achieved a major molecular response, a molecular response with a 4.0-log reduction, and a molecular response with a 4.5-log reduction, respectively.

Results: Ninety-four patients suffered from 115 serious cutaneous reactions due to oral protein kinase inhibitors. Serious cutaneous reactions more frequently reported were maculo-papular rash (mostly with imatinib), followed by hand-foot syndrome (specifically with sorafenib) and papulopustular rash (particularly with erlotinib).

A hallmark of both Ph+ and Ph-like B-ALL is constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase signaling that is potentially targetable with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). B-ALL cells also receive extracellular signals from the microenvironment that can maintain proliferation and survival following treatment with TKIs. Therefore, there is strong rationale for combining TKIs with other therapies targeting signal transduction pathways. Here we show that combinations of the ABL-directed TKI dasatinib with mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs) are more effective than TKI alone against patient-derived Ph-like B-ALL cells harboring rearrangements of ABL1 or ABL2. We also report the establishment of a new human Ph-like B-ALL cell line that is stromal cell-independent in vitro and can be used for xenograft experiments in vivo.

The bacterium is a cause of serious infections of the respiratory tract, particularly for those with cystic fibrosis and for those with burn injuries. Pyocyanin induces oxidative stress and causes cells to become prematurely senescent, which compromises tissue remodeling and wound repair. A diverse range of antioxidants have been found useful in preventing oxidant-induced cellular senescence, including quercetin, a common dietary polyphenol. This study evaluated the effectiveness of three common polyphenols (quercetin, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin) as potential inhibitors of pyocyanin-induced senescence. Whereas at the lowest concentration the polyphenols maintained cellular replicative capacity, in the presence of pyocyanin they unexpectedly displayed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity with a rank order of quercetin>epicatechin>>catechin. On oxidation, polyphenols with B-ring catechol functionality form toxic alkylating quinones that are normally inactivated by cellular antioxidant defense and redox maintenance systems, including reduction by ascorbate and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Pyocyanin inhibited cellular NQO1 activity at low micromolar concentrations, but the presence of exogenous ascorbate eliminated pyocyanin-induced polyphenol cytotoxicity. These data indicate that pyocyanin compromises cellular redox maintenance systems, leaving cells susceptible to the adverse effects of otherwise nontoxic redox-active compounds.", relevance: "0.61"},

Choosing the most appropriate TKI requires clinicians to consider a host of patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors, not the least of which include the safety profiles of the agents. This review discusses the potential impact of treatment-, patient-, and disease-related characteristics on the emergence of adverse events during TKI therapy, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms believed to be responsible for a number of important adverse events associated with these agents and what implications they may have for treatment choice, particularly in the setting of first-line treatment. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles that described the molecular mechanisms of BCR-ABL1-mediated leukemic transformation, the efficacy and safety of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib in patients with CML, the kinase-binding spectrum of each TKI, and evidence suggesting a link between the TKI-binding profile and adverse events. The pattern of adverse events associated with each agent is important when selecting treatment with a TKI. Clinical studies suggest that imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib have differing safety profiles, which are in part attributable to the specificity and selectivity of each agent. Although much basic research must be conducted to further illuminate the mechanisms responsible for TKI-related adverse events, on- and off-target effects are believed to be at least partly responsible for cardiovascular toxicity, myelosuppression, fluid retention, gastrointestinal toxicity, and dermatologic toxicity. Increased understanding of the factors that affect TKI-associated adverse events and long-term safety data will enable a more informed approach to the selection of therapy best suited to the individual needs of patients with CML.", relevance: "0.6"},

The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA(Â®)) is the default dictionary for adverse event (AE) reporting in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The ontology of adverse events (OAE) represents AEs as pathological processes occurring after drug exposures. Objectives: The aim of this work was to establish a semantic framework to link biological mechanisms to phenotypes of AEs by combining OAE with MedDRA(Â®) in FAERS data analysis. We investigated the AEs associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting tyrosine kinases. The five selected TKIs/mAbs (i.e., dasatinib, imatinib, lapatinib, cetuximab, and trastuzumab) are known to induce impaired ventricular function (non-QT) cardiotoxicity. Results: Statistical analysis of FAERS data identified 1053 distinct MedDRA(Â®) terms significantly associated with TKIs/mAbs, where 884 did not have corresponding OAE terms. We manually annotated these terms, added them to OAE by the standard OAE development strategy, and mapped them to MedDRA(Â®). The data integration to provide insights into molecular mechanisms of drug-associated AEs was performed by including linkages in OAE for all related AE terms to MedDRA(Â®) and the existing ontologies, including the human phenotype ontology (HP), Uber anatomy ontology (UBERON), and gene ontology (GO). Sixteen AEs were shared by all five TKIs/mAbs, and each of 17 cardiotoxicity AEs was associated with at least one TKI/mAb. As an example, we analyzed cardiac failure using the relations established in OAE with other ontologies and demonstrated that one of the biological processes associated with cardiac failure maps to the genes associated with heart contraction. Conclusion: By expanding the existing OAE ontological design, our TKI use case demonstrated that the combination of OAE and MedDRA(Â®) provides a semantic framework to link clinical phenotypes of adverse drug events to biological mechanisms.", relevance: "0.6"},

In this study, we investigated the effect of TKIs on the levels of plasma TPO concentration in patients with well-controlled chronic myeloid leukemia receiving imatinib or dasatinib and those in treatment-free remission (TFR). Methods: Blood samples for blood cell counts and plasma TPO levels were obtained from 23 dasatinib-treated patients before and 1 h after intake, 11 patients treated with imatinib before and 2 h after intake, and nine TFR patients. Levels of plasma TPO were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Levels of TPO were significantly inversely correlated with platelet counts in the entire cohort (r = - 0.568, p < 0.0001). Dasatinib intake, but not imatinib, significantly reduced platelet counts after intake (p = 0.0009 in dasatinib and p = 0.5431 in imatinib). However, imatinib and dasatinib intake increased the levels of TPO in these patients (p = 0.0024, dasatinib; p = 0.0098, imatinib). Conclusions: Our study results suggest that neither dasatinib nor imatinib therapy inhibits TPO production. Rather, transient increases in TPO levels seen with these two treatments might be a result of the decrease in TPO clearance these TKIs confer.

Results: QR-333 reduced the severity of numbness, jolting pain, and irritation from baseline values. Improvements were also seen in overall and specific quality-of-life measures. QR-333 was well tolerated. Eleven patients in the QR-333 group reported 23 adverse events (all mild or moderate); 4 in the placebo group reported 5 events (all moderate). One patient who applied QR-333 noted a pricking sensation twice, the only adverse event considered possibly related to study treatment. Conclusions: From this preliminary safety study, it appears that QR-333 may safely offer relief of symptoms of diabetic neuropathy and improve quality of life.

A large cohort of 397 patients-320 treated front line with imatinib, 25 with dasatinib, and 53 with nilotinib-was retrospectively analyzed at a single institution. The eGFR was calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation for all patients at baseline and then at 6 and 12 months, and at the last follow-up. Taking into account eGFR changes during the first year of treatment and excluding other possible cardiovascular risk factors, we considered also the percentage of cardiovascular events in patients with modifications of this single parameter. Imatinib induced a decrease in median eGFR (p = 0.01): 42 patients treated with imatinib had a cardiovascular event, related to modification of eGFR, in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors. In patients treated with nilotinib, the median eGFR did not decline from baseline: only 1 patient experienced an ischemic event, but the eGFR remained unchanged. In patients treated with dasatinib, the mean eGFR did not change significantly: 3 patients experienced a cardiac ischemic event, but in all patients the eGFR remained unchanged over time, while advanced age and metabolic alterations contributed to the ischemic events. This long-term follow-up has documented that imatinib may induce changes in the eGFR, which may contribute to the onset of ischemic events. Further analyses on larger series of CML patients are required to conclusively define the potential renal toxicity of second generation TKIs and the consequent risk of developing ischemic events.", relevance: "0.59"},

Little has been reported on the incidence and clinical presentation of such AEs in pediatric patients with cancer. To address this gap, we analyzed the dermatologic AEs reported across clinical trials of targeted anticancer therapies in pediatric patients. Procedures: We conducted an electronic literature search (PubMed, American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCIs Pediatric Oncology Branch webpage) to identify clinical trials involving targeted anticancer therapies that reported dermatologic AEs in their safety data. Studies were limited to the pediatric population, monotherapy trials (oncology), and English language publications. Results: Pooled data from 19 clinical studies investigating 11 targeted anticancer agents (alemtuzumab, rituximab, imatinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, vandetanib, sorafenib, cabozantinib, pazopanib, everolimus, and temsirolimus) were analyzed. The most frequently encountered dermatologic AEs were rash (127/660; 19%), xerosis (18/100; 18%), mucositis (68/402; 17%), and pruritus (12/169; 7%).

Conclusion: This study describes the dermatologic manifestations of targeted anticancer therapy-related AEs in the pediatric population. Since these AEs are often associated with significant morbidity, it is imperative that pediatric oncologists be familiar with their recognition and management, to avoid unnecessary dose modifications and/or termination, and to prevent impairments in patients quality of life.", relevance: "0.58"},

Relevant VAE comprise peripheral, cerebral, and coronary artery changes in patients receiving nilotinib, venous and arterial occlusive events during ponatinib therapy, and pulmonary hypertension in patients receiving dasatinib. Although each TKI binds to a unique profile of molecular targets in leukemic cells and vascular cells, the exact etiology of drug-induced vasculopathies remains uncertain. Recent data suggest that predisposing molecular factors, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors as well as certain comorbidities contribute to the etiology of VAE in these patients. In addition, direct effects of these TKI on vascular endothelial cells have been demonstrated and are considered to contribute essentially to VAE evolution. In the current article, we discuss mechanisms underlying the occurrence of VAE in TKI-treated patients with CML, with special emphasis on vascular and perivascular target cells and involved molecular (vascular) targets of VAE-triggering TKI.

A phase 2 trial of dasatinib in melanoma was conducted to assess response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity. Methods: Adults with stage 3/4 chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve unresectable melanoma were eligible. Dasatinib was initially administered at 100 mg twice daily continuously to 17 patients. Due to toxicity, the starting dosage was decreased to 70 mg twice daily. Tumor assessments occurred every 8 weeks.

We here report that exposure of developing human monocyte-derived dendritic cells to the BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib results in profound upregulation of the transmembrane glycoprotein osteoactivin that has recently been characterized as a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Thus, in line with osteoactivin upregulation, exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors resulted in significantly reduced stimulatory capacity of dendritic cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions that could be restored by the addition of blocking anti-osteoactivin antibody.

According to European LeukemiaNet recommendations, the clinical response of CML patients receiving TKI therapy should be evaluated after 3, 6, and 12 months. For patients not achieving a satisfactory response within 3 months, the mean plasma concentration for the three months of TKI administration must be considered. In TKI therapy for CML patients, therapeutic drug monitoring is a new strategy for dosage optimization to obtain a faster and more effective clinical response. The imatinib plasma trough concentration (Câ) should be set above 1000 ng/mL to obtain a response and below 3000 ng/mL to avoid serious adverse events such as neutropenia. For patients with a UGT1A1*6/*6, *6/*28, or *28/*28 genotype initially administered 300-400 mg/d, a target nilotinib Câ of 500 ng/mL is recommended to prevent elevation of bilirubin levels, whereas for patients with the UGT1A1*1 allele initially administered 600 mg/d, a target nilotinib Câ of 800 ng/mL is recommended.

Senescence was determined by the SA-Î²-galactosidase assay, and apoptosis by caspase-3 activity, WB, and TUNEL. MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38), AMPK, and Akt/mTOR were analyzed by WB. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) were evaluated by FC and fluorescence microscopy. Key findings: 1,8-Cineole inhibited cell proliferation by promoting G0/G1 arrest. While 1,8-cineole was unable to trigger apoptosis, it induced cellular senescence. 1,8-Cineole promoted ROS production, ÎÎ¨m depolarization, AMPK, ERK, and p38 activation and mTOR inhibition. Antioxidants, like N-acetyl-L-cysteine and vitamins, prevented HepG2 cell growth inhibition and senescence induced by 1,8-cineole. Pre-incubation with 1,8-cineole sensitized HepG2 cells to the anti-senescence compounds, quercetin, simvastatin, U0126, and SB202190. Combinations of 1,8-cineole and each compound synergistically inhibited cell viability, and combined treatment with 1,8-cineole and simvastatin induced apoptosis. Significance: 1,8-Cineole induces G0/G1 arrest and senescence in HepG2 cells through oxidative stress and MAPK, AMPK, and Akt/mTOR pathways, and sensitizes cells to anti-senescence drugs, suggesting that 1,8-cineole has potential as an antineoplastic and adjuvant compound in combination with anti-senescence drugs in HCC therapy.", relevance: "0.54"},

We have defined protein kinase C-Î´ (PKCÎ´) as a regulator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis and have shown that phosphorylation of PKCÎ´ by c-Abl and c-Src activates its proapoptotic function. Here, we have explored the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of c-Src and c-Abl to block activation of PKCÎ´ for radioprotection of the salivary gland. Dasatinib, imatinib, and bosutinib all suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCÎ´ and inhibited IR-induced apoptosis in vitro To determine whether TKIs can provide radioprotection of salivary gland function in vivo, mice were treated with TKIs and a single or fractionated doses of irradiation. Delivery of dasatinib or imatinib within 3 hours of a single or fractionated dose of irradiation resulted in >75% protection of salivary gland function at 60 days. Continuous dosing with dasatinib extended protection to at least 5 months and correlated with histologic evidence of salivary gland acinar cell regeneration. Pretreatment with TKIs had no impact on clonogenic survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, and in mice harboring HNSCC cell-derived xenografts, combining dasatinib or imatinib with fractionated irradiation did not enhance tumor growth.

Dasatinib, a second-generation STKI inhibitor widely studied, proved high efficiency in CML patients resistant to imatinib. In the last decade STKIs have also been implicated and showed therapeutic potential for the treatment of diverse pathologies other than cancer. In this regard, we review the properties of STKIs, dasatinib in particular, including its immunomodulatory role.

We have previously demonstrated evidence of a pro-thrombotic state associated with nilotinib, using microvascular and arterial thrombosis C57BL/6 mouse models. In this study, we examined ponatinib and determined if a calcium channel blocker could ameliorate the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory phenotypes. In vitro treatment of whole human or murine blood with ponatinib and nilotinib increased platelet activation, adhesion and three-dimensional thrombi over time compared with vehicle control or other TKIs. Treatment of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with ponatinib and nilotinib but not imatinib, dasatinib or vehicle control for 4 hours significantly increased thrombus growth following ex vivo perfusion on collagen and FeCl3-induced vascular injury of mesenteric arterioles and carotid artery in vivo and increased plasma levels of soluble P-selectin, tumour necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, interferon-Î³ and thromboxane B2 (TxB2). Ponatinib-treated CML patients had increased ex vivo thrombus formation and a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared with healthy controls. Pre-treatment of mice with the calcium channel antagonist, diltiazem, prior to ponatinib or nilotinib reversed the pro-thrombotic phenotype and the increase in cytokine levels.

A systematic evaluation of drug skin permeation via photoaged skin is lacking. Objectives: The aim of this work was to investigate whether UVA and UVB affect absorption by the skin of drugs and sunscreens, including tetracycline, quercetin, and oxybenzone. Methods: The dorsal skin of nude mice was subjected to UVA (24 and 39 J/cm(2)) or UVB (150, 200, and 250 mJ/cm(2)) irradiation. Levels of skin water loss, erythema, and sebum were evaluated, and histological examinations of COX-2 and claudin-1 expressions were carried out. Permeation of the permeants into and through the skin was determined in vitro using a Franz cell. In vivo skin uptake was also evaluated. Senescent skin (24 weeks old) was used for comparison. Results: Wrinkling and scaling were significant signs of skin treated with UVA and UVB, respectively. The level of claudin-1, an indicator of tight junctions (TJs), was reduced by UVA and UVB irradiation. UVA enhanced tetracycline and quercetin skin deposition by 11- and 2-fold, respectively. A similar enhancement was shown for flux profiles. Surprisingly, a lower UVA dose revealed greater enhancement compared to the higher dose. The skin deposition and flux of tetracycline both decreased with UVB exposure. UVB also significantly reduced quercetin flux. The skin absorption behavior of chronologically aged skin approximated that of the UVA group, with photoaged skin showing higher enhancement. UV generally exhibited a negligible effect on modulating oxybenzone permeation. Conclusions: Skin disruption produced by UV does not necessarily result in enhanced skin absorption. It depends on the UV wavelength, irradiated energy, and physicochemical properties of the permeant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report establishing drug permeation profiles for UV-irradiated skin.", relevance: "0.53"},

While imatinib remains a frontline therapy for CML, patients with advanced disease frequently develop resistance to imatinib therapy through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include insufficient potency at therapeutic doses, activation of alternate oncogenic pathways, and overexpression of the multidrug-resistant gene. One of the possible causes of imatinib-acquired resistance is associated with increased expression of the SRC-related kinase Lyn and loss of BCR-ABL dependence arising from sequence mutations. In December 2005, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it has completed the rolling NDA submission to the US FDA for dasatinib in the treatment of CML in chronic, accelerated or blast phases, as well as Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior treatment. At the Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Day in May 2005, the company stated that it plans to evaluate dasatinib in solid tumours. In in vitro assays, dasatinib induced apoptosis and had potent activity in the imatinib-resistant tumour cells lines and CML patient specimens. It effectively inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing nearly all imatinib-resistant isoforms. In vivo, dasatinib has shown efficacy, with no apparent toxicity, when administered orally in SCID mice with xenografts of imatinib-sensitive and resistant human CML cells lines.

Characteristics and incidence of new-onset CV-AEs and AT-AEs were analyzed. Poisson regression models assessed factors associated with AE incidence. Median follow-up was 94 months (range, 2-195). Overall, 237 patients (45%) developed CV-AEs and 46 (9%) developed AT-AEs. Hypertension was the most common AE seen in 175 patients (33%; grade 3/4 in 17%). CV-AE and AT-AE incidence ratios (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 8.6 (7.6-9.8) and 1.7 (1.2-2.2) per 100 person-years.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in AEC has been observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a disease of aging.Objectives: To investigate a causal role for ER stress in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and therapeutic potential of ER stress inhibition in PF.Methods: The role of ER stress in AEC dysfunction and fibrosis was studied in mice with tamoxifen (Tmx)-inducible deletion of ER chaperone Grp78, a key regulator of ER homeostasis, in alveolar type II (AT2) cells, progenitors of distal lung epithelium, and in IPF lung slice cultures.Measurements and Main Results: Grp78 deletion caused weight loss, mortality, lung inflammation, and spatially heterogeneous fibrosis characterized by fibroblastic foci, hyperplastic AT2 cells, and increased susceptibility of old and male mice, all features of IPF. Fibrosis was more persistent in more severely injured Grp78 knockout (KO) mice. Grp78 KO AT2 cells showed evidence of ER stress, apoptosis, senescence, impaired progenitor capacity, and activation of TGF-Î² (transforming growth factor-Î²)/SMAD signaling. Glucose-regulated protein 78 is reduced in AT2 cells from old mice and patients with IPF, and ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid ameliorates ER stress and fibrosis in Grp78 KO mouse and IPF lung slice cultures.Conclusions: These results support a causal role for ER stress and resulting epithelial dysfunction in PF and suggest ER stress as a potential mechanism linking aging to IPF.

Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime treatment costs and health outcomes for TKI sequences for treatment of patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib. Five health states were included, chronic phase 2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses were conducted for key inputs. Results: In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences provide the most survival (ÎLYs = 0.2-2.0), QALYs (ÎQALYs = 0.2-1.9), and accrue highest CML-related costs (ÎCosts = $64,000-$222,000).

The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs nilotinib-initiating sequences is $170,000 for an imatinib-resistant population, and $160,000 for an imatinib-intolerant population. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that dasatinib is associated with increased survival and quality of life compared to high dose imatinib and to a smaller extent with nilotinib, among patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib, primarily based on higher cytogenetic response rates observed in clinical studies of dasatinib. Head-to-head studies of sequential use of dasatinib and nilotinib are needed to validate the model findings of improved survival (LYs) with better quality-of-life (QALYs) for patients initiating dasatinib in 2nd-line.

In addition, quercetin delayed the progression of senescence in the pancreatic islets after in vivo transplantation. Thus, local delivery of antioxidants like quercetin may be an attractive way to improve outcomes in cell therapy.", relevance: "0.52"},

The program now includes nine medications: bexarotene, dasatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, nilotinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and vorinostat. Patients receive frequent assessments to encourage adherence, identify adverse events, and track discontinuations through a pharmacist outreach at the initiation of therapy, day 10 and 20 of the first month, then monthly thereafter. The use of oral agents is increasing in cancer patients, shifting away from regimens exclusively involving intravenous chemotherapy. This offers advantages for patients in terms of convenience, but introduces risk as patients become more responsible for the administration and monitoring of the medications. Purpose: To evaluate utilization patterns of the oral oncology medications in the CMP including adverse event occurrence, medication discontinuations, and adherence markers. Methods: This study is a retrospective review of patient-reported data from the CMP assessments completed in 2013. Data collected include adverse events and grades, adherence markers, and discontinuation rates. A total of 1163 assessments were reviewed from 557 patients. The assessments included in the analysis were the initial assessment, 10-day assessment, 20-day assessment, and the first monthly follow-up assessment, which encompasses the first two months of therapy. Results: A total of 1453 adverse events were reported. Adverse events were cited as the reason for 39% of discontinuations and 28% of missed/held doses. A total of 101 discontinuations were reported across the nine CMP medications based on the first two months of data. Missed or held doses were reported in 130 assessments. Conclusions: Patient engagement and pharmacist interventions, through programs such as the CMP, are important to help patients manage these complex, high-risk medications.", relevance: "0.51"},

Here, we show that in mouse models of BCR-ABL1 leukemia, Ikzf1 and Arf alterations synergistically promote the development of an aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Ikzf1 alterations result in acquisition of stem cell-like features, including self-renewal and increased bone marrow stromal adhesion. Retinoid receptor agonists reversed this phenotype, partly by inducing expression of IKZF1, resulting in abrogation of adhesion and self-renewal, cell cycle arrest, and attenuation of proliferation without direct cytotoxicity. Retinoids potentiated the activity of dasatinib in mouse and human BCR-ABL1 ALL, providing an additional therapeutic option in IKZF1-mutated ALL.", relevance: "0.51"},

Of importance to metastatic CaP, which frequently metastasises to bone, SFK are also vital to the regulation of bone remodelling. We sought to determine the ability of dasatinib to inhibit growth of CaP in bone. Methods: C4-2B CaP cells were injected into tibiae of SCID mice and treated with dasatinib, alone or in combination with docetaxel. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels, bone mineral density, radiographs and histology were analysed. Results: Treatment with dasatinib alone significantly lowered sacrifice serum prostate-specific antigen levels compared to control, 2.3+/-0.4 vs 9.2+/-2.1 (P=0.004). Combination therapy improved efficacy over dasatinib alone (P=0.010). Dasatinib increased bone mineral density in tumoured tibiae by 25% over control tumoured tibiae (P<0.001). Conclusion: Dasatinib inhibits growth of C4-2B cells in bone with improved efficacy when combined with docetaxel. Additionally, dasatinib inhibits osteolysis associated with CaP. These data support further study of dasatinib in clinical trials for men with CaP bone metastases.", relevance: "0.51"},

Microfluidic devices allow human blood to clot on a defined surface under controlled hemodynamic and pharmacological conditions. The potencies of a number of antiplatelet and anticancer drugs have been tested with respect to platelet deposition on collagen under flow. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) reduce platelet deposition, either when added ex vivo to blood or ingested orally by patients prior to testing. Some individuals display a functional aspirin-insensitivity in microfluidic assay. When certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are taken orally, they block COX-1 acetylation by aspirin with concomitant reduction of aspirin efficacy against platelets in microfluidic assay. Both P2Y1 and P2Y12 inhibitors reduce platelet deposition under flow, as do NO donors and iloprost that target the guanylate cyclase and the prostacyclin receptor, respectively. In a microfluidic assay of 37 kinase inhibitors, dasatinib had potent antiplatelet activity, while bosutinib was less potent. Dasatinib and bosutinib have known profiles against numerous kinases, revealing overlapping and nonoverlapping activities relevant to their unique actions against platelets. Also, dasatinib caused a marked and specific inhibition of GPVI signaling induced by convulxin, consistent with a dasatinib-associated bleeding risk. Microfluidic devices facilitate drug library screening, dose-response testing, and drug-drug interaction studies. Kinase inhibitors developed as anticancer agents may present antiplatelet activities that are detectable by microfluidic assay and potentially linked to bleeding risks.", relevance: "0.51"},

Background: Treatment of CML has been revolutionised with the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) kinase. Imatinib is the only first-line TKI currently available for the treatment of CML; however, intolerance and resistance remain significant clinical challenges. The approved second-line treatment options for CML are dasatinib, nilotinib or escalated-dose imatinib. Design: Review article. Methods: Searches of PubMed, ASCO and ASH electronic databases for relevant search terms were performed between July 2008-January 2009. Findings: Dasatinib has no cross-intolerance with imatinib, and the most frequent AEs (cytopenias and pleural and pericardial effusions) can generally be managed by dose interruption and reduction. Nilotinib has a high degree of haematologic cross-intolerance with first-line imatinib. As might be expected, high-dose imatinib has the potential for more severe AEs than standard-dose imatinib. Conclusions: There are known safety issues inherent to each TKI and close monitoring by nursing staff is necessary to identify and effectively manage AEs. Relevance to clinical practice: All three TKIs have demonstrated potential for fluid retention and cardiotoxicity. Nurses should be aware of how these AEs manifest and intervene appropriately. The safety profiles of these TKIs clearly differs and it is important to consider factors such as comorbidities when making treatment decisions.", relevance: "0.51"},

According to the current classification PAH can be associated with exposure to certain drugs or toxins, particularly to appetite suppressant intake drugs, such as aminorex, fenfluramine derivatives and benfluorex. These drugs have been confirmed to be risk factors for PAH and were withdrawn from the market. The supposed mechanism is an increase in serotonin levels, which was demonstrated to act as a growth factor for the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Amphetamines, phentermine and mazindol were less frequently used, but are considered possible risk factors, for PAH. Dasatinib, dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia was associated with cases of severe PAH, potentially in part reversible after dasatinib withdrawal. Recently, several studies have raised the issue of potential endothelial dysfunction that could be induced by interferon, and a few cases of PAH have been reported with interferon therapy. PAH remains a rare complication of these drugs, suggesting possible individual susceptibility, and further studies are needed to identify patients at risk of drug-induced PAH.", relevance: "0.51"},

The expression status of Lyn and its correlation with multiple clinical parameters including cell differentiation degree, different cytogenetic risk classification, and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were thus investigated. To address the mechanisms underlying the involvement of Lyn in differentiation induction, the effects of dasatinib, an inhibitor for SFKs including Lyn, on the alterations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)- or dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3)-induced differentiation, and c-Myc protein expression were investigated. Methods: Primary AML blasts were obtained from 31 newly diagnosed AML patients with different French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. The expression of phosphorylated and total Lyn, c-Myc, and CD11b, CD11c and CD15 was analyzed by flow cytometry. The activation of Akt and Erk known to be involved in the regulation of c-Myc expression was investigated using western blotting. Results: Significant higher expression levels of total Lyn were observed in AML patients with favorable cytogenetics, higher MPO activity and FAB M2 subtype. A clear positive correlation between the expression levels of Lyn and differentiation status of primary AML blasts was observed. Dasatinib inhibited the expression of phosphorylated Lyn, and further enhanced the differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA and VD3 in HL-60 cells. Augmented downregulation of c-Myc protein expression was observed in the combination treatment with ATRA, VD3 and dasatinib compared to treatment with each reagent alone in HL-60 cells. The suppression of the activation of Akt and Erk was also observed concomitantly. Conclusions: The expression level of total Lyn is closely linked to the differentiation status of AML blasts. The enhancement of differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA/VD3 by dasatinib suggested that Lyn was associated in the negative regulation of ATRA/VD3-induced HL-60 cells differentiation. The enhancement probably was attributed to the downregulation of c-Myc implicated with the suppression of the activation of Akt and Erk. These results provide novel insights into a possible combinational therapeutic approach by targeting Lyn for AML patients, and offer new possibilities for the combination therapy with VD3 and dasatinib.", relevance: "0.5"},

We also describe how common side effects can be effectively managed and offer a working definition of intolerance that may be useful to clinicians when they consider switching between TKIs.", relevance: "0.5"},
