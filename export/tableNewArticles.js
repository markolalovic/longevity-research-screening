Senescent cells accumulate in multiple tissues with aging and at etiological sites of multiple chronic disorders. The senolytic drug combination, Dasatinib plus Quercetin (D+Q), is known to reduce senescent cell abundance in aged mice. However, the effects of long-term D+Q treatment on intestinal senescent cell and inflammatory burden and microbiome composition in aged mice remain unknown. Here, we examine the effect of D+Q on senescence (p16 Ink4a and p21 Cip1) and inflammation (Cxcl1, Il1β, Il6, Mcp1, and Tnfα) markers in small (ileum) and large (caecum and colon) intestine in aged mice (n=10) compared to age-matched placebo-treated mice (n=10). Additionally, we examine microbial composition along the intestinal tract in these mice. D+Q-treated mice show significantly lower senescent cell (p16 and p21 expression) and inflammatory (Cxcl1, Il1β, Il6, Mcp1 and Tnfα expression) burden in small and large intestine compared with control mice. Further, we find specific microbial signatures in ileal, cecal, colonic and fecal regions that are distinctly modulated by D+Q, with modulation being most prominent in small intestine. Further analyses reveal specific correlation of senescence and inflammation markers with specific microbial signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that the senolytic treatment reduces intestinal senescence and inflammation while altering specific microbiota signatures and suggest that the optimized senolytic regimens might improve health via reducing intestinal senescence, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in older subjects.", relevance: "0.99"},

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of pleural effusion (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with CML treated with dasatinib at Peking University Peoples Hospital from April 2008 to January 2020. Results: A total of 280 patients were collected. The median dasatinib treatment time was 26 (1-142) months. Ninety (32.1%) patients developed PE, including 40 (44.4%) in grade 1, 44 (48.9%) in grade 2, and 6 (6.7%) in grade 3. The incidence of PE increased gradually with the prolongation of treatment. The multivariate analysis showed that increasing age (every 10 years, HR=1.6; P<0.001) , advanced phase when starting dasatinib therapy (HR=2.2; P=0.008) , and cardiovascular comorbidity (ies) (HR=1.9; P=0.018) were significantly associated with developing PE. The advanced phase when starting dasatinib therapy (HR=3.4; P=0.001) , interval from diagnosis to taking TKI for ≤6 months (HR=2.2; P=0.015) , and dose < 100 mg/d when PE was found (HR=3.1; P=0.001) were associated with more severe PE. PE relieved or disappeared after intervention in half of the patients. Among 60 patients with symptoms of cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, 49 underwent ultrasonic cardiography; 8 (16.3%) had high probability of PAH, approximately 3.5% in all patients; and 6 (75.0%) of them had PE. PAH was reversible. There was no difference in the incidences of PE and PAH between branded and Chinese generic dasatinib. Conclusion: PE is a common dasatinib-related pulmonary adverse event, and PAH is rare in patients with CML. The identification of individuals with high risk, close monitoring, and timely intervention may help to alleviate PE and PAH.", relevance: "0.97"},

These senescent cells enhance the pro-inflammatory environment that, with time, contributes to the onset of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. Glucose intolerance in mouse models of obesity has been successfully reversed by the elimination of senescent cells with the senolytic compounds navitoclax or the combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D/Q). In this work, we generated obese mice by high-fat diet feeding, and treated them with five consecutive cycles of navitoclax or D/Q during 16 weeks. We observed an efficient reduction in the white adipose tissue of the senescence markers senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, Cdkn2a-p16 and Cdkn2a-p19 at the end of the 5 cycles. Mice treated with both navitoclax and D/Q showed an improvement of their insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance during a short period of time (cycles 3 and 4), that disappeared at the fifth cycle. Also, these mice tended to increase the expression at their adipose tissue of the adipogenic genes Pparg and, Cebpa, as well as their plasma adiponectin levels. Together, our work shows that two different senolytic treatments, acting through independent pathways, are transiently effective in the treatment of obesity-induced metabolic disorders.", relevance: "0.96"},

The first senolytic drugs Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin and Navitoclax were discovered using a hypothesis-driven approach. SC accumulate with ageing and at causal sites of multiple chronic disorders, including diseases accounting for the bulk of morbidity, mortality and health expenditures. The most deleterious SC are resistant to apoptosis and have up-regulation of anti-apoptotic pathways which defend SC against their own inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), allowing them to survive, despite killing neighbouring cells. Senolytics transiently disable these SCAPs, causing apoptosis of those SC with a tissue-destructive SASP. Because SC take weeks to reaccumulate, senolytics can be administered intermittently - a hit-and-run approach. In preclinical models, senolytics delay, prevent or alleviate frailty, cancers and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, liver, kidney, musculoskeletal, lung, eye, haematological, metabolic and skin disorders as well as complications of organ transplantation, radiation and cancer treatment. As anticipated for agents targeting the fundamental ageing mechanisms that are root cause contributors to multiple disorders, potential uses of senolytics are protean, potentially alleviating over 40 conditions in preclinical studies, opening a new route for treating age-related dysfunction and diseases. Early pilot trials of senolytics suggest they decrease senescent cells, reduce inflammation and alleviate frailty in humans. Clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimers disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, eye diseases and bone marrow transplant and childhood cancer survivors are underway or beginning. Until such studies are done, it is too early for senolytics to be used outside of clinical trials.", relevance: "0.96"},

Clearance of senescent cells has been shown to improve brain function in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is still unknown whether senescent cell clearance alleviates cognitive dysfunction during the aging process. To investigate this, we first conducted single-nuclei and single-cell RNA-seq in the hippocampus from young and aged mice. We observed an age-dependent increase in p16Ink4a senescent cells, which was more pronounced in microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and characterized by a SASP. We then aged INK-ATTAC mice, in which p16Ink4a -positive senescent cells can be genetically eliminated upon treatment with the drug AP20187 and treated them either with AP20187 or with the senolytic cocktail Dasatinib and Quercetin. We observed that both strategies resulted in a decrease in p16Ink4a exclusively in the microglial population, resulting in reduced microglial activation and reduced expression of SASP factors. Importantly, both approaches significantly improved cognitive function in aged mice.

The mechanism of CKD post-AKI, characterized by progressive renal fibrosis, is still unclear. Maladaptive tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after AKI are considered a leading cause of renal fibrosis post-AKI. TECs under maladaptive repair manifest characteristics of senescence. Removing senescent TECs by genetic ablation has been proven effective in reducing renal fibrosis. Senolytics, which eliminate senescent cells by pharmacological intervention, have been studied in a series of degenerative diseases. To our knowledge, the effects of senolytics on renal fibrosis post-AKI have not been verified before. Here, we confirmed renal senescence in the unilateral ischemia/reperfusion injury murine model. Senescent TECs could activate fibroblasts and senolytics specifically induced apoptosis of senescent TECs. Next, we demonstrated that senolytics could reduce renal senescence and ameliorate renal fibrosis in both unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and multiple-cisplatin-treatment murine models. Our results indicate senescent TECs as a vital factor in renal fibrosis progression, and senolytic therapy might be promising for treating CKD post-AKI.", relevance: "0.93"},

However, the result was not always satisfactory and the reasons remained unresolved. Because aging is recognized as an important risk factor for OA and chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) could acquire senescent phenotype, we made a hypothesis that CPCs senescence could have harmful effect on chondrogenesis and the outcome of distraction arthroplasty could be improved by eliminating senescent CPCs pharmacologically. Methods: The role of senescent CPCs on distraction arthroplasty was first determined by comparing the cartilage samples from the failure and non-failure patients. Next, the biological behaviors of senescent CPCs were observed in the in vitro cell culture and IHP model. Finally, the beneficial effect of senescent CPCs clearance by senolytic dasatinib and quercetin (DQ) on cartilage regeneration was observed in the in vitro and in vivo IHP model. Results: Larger quantities of senescent CPCs along with increased IL-1 β secretion were demonstrated in the failure patients of distraction arthroplasty. Senescent CPCs revealed impaired proliferation and chondrogenic capability and also had increased IL-1 β synthesis, typical of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). CPCs senescence and SASP formation were mutually dependent in vitro. Greater amounts of senescent CPCs were negatively correlated with IHP-induced chondrogenesis. In contrast, chondrogenesis could be significantly improved by DQ pretreatment which selectively induced senescent CPCs into apoptosis in the in vitro and in vivo IHP model. Mechanistically, senescent CPCs elimination could decrease SASP formation and therefore promote the proliferation and chondrogenic regeneration capacity of the surrounding survived CPCs under IHP stimulation. Conclusions: Eliminating senescent CPCs by senolytics could decrease SASP formation and improve the result of joint distraction arthroplasty effectively.

This includes increased secretion of many inflammatory agents, proteases, miRNAs, and others. Cell senescence has been widely studied in oncogenesis and has generally been considered to be protective, due to cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of proliferation. Cell senescence is also associated with ageing and extensive experimental data support its role in generating the ageing-associated phenotype. Senescent cells can also influence proximal healthy cells through SASPs and, e.g., inhibit normal development of progenitor/stem cells, thereby preventing tissue replacement of dying cells and reducing organ functions. Recent evidence demonstrates that SASPs may also play important roles in several chronic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. White adipose tissue (WAT) cells are highly susceptible to becoming senescent both with ageing but also with obesity and type 2 diabetes, independently of chronological age. WAT senescence is associated with inappropriate expansion (hypertrophy) of adipocytes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Major efforts have been made to identify approaches to delete senescent cells including the use of senolytic compounds. The most established senolytic treatment to date is the combination of dasatinib, an antagonist of the SRC family of kinases, and the antioxidant quercetin. This combination reduces cell senescence and improves chronic disorders in experimental animal models. Although only small and short-term studies have been performed in man, no severe adverse effects have been reported. Hopefully, these or other senolytic agents may provide novel ways to prevent and treat different chronic diseases in man. Here we review the current knowledge on cellular senescence in both murine and human studies. We also discuss the pathophysiological role of this process and the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting senescence selectively in WAT.", relevance: "0.91"},

Depleting senescent HSCs by senolytic treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence for FBP1 as a metabolic tumour suppressor in liver cancer and establish a critical crosstalk between hepatocyte metabolism and HSC senescence that promotes tumour growth.", relevance: "0.8"},

When initially present, dasatinib potently inhibited platelet deposition on collagen (no TF). Furthermore, dasatinib immediately inhibited subsequent platelet deposition when introduced 90 s after clot initiation. However, when thrombin was generated, dasatinib was markedly less potent against platelet deposition on collagen/TF (but blocked fibrin deposition) and had no effect when added 90 s after clot initiation. Similarly, dasatinib added at 90 s had no effect on clotting on collagen/TF when fibrin was also blocked with Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, indicating that strong thrombin-induced signaling (but not fibrin-induced signaling) can bypass the SFK inhibition at later times. The Syk inhibitor GS-9973 was less potent than dasatinib when present initially, but inhibited clot growth when added at 90 s, even in the presence of thrombin (±fibrin).

Here, we examined the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to dasatinib in five TNBC cell lines. First, we divided the TNBC cell lines into those sensitive or resistant to dasatinib and found that activation of Src was inhibited in all of the cell lines. In contrast, we found that dasatinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation in only the dasatinib-sensitive cell lines. Consequently, we found that combination treatment with dasatinib and an inhibitor of Akt or mTOR suppressed cell proliferation more than did either monotherapy in the dasatinib-resistant cell lines. Finally, to mimic intrinsic resistance, we established a dasatinib-tolerant TNBC cell line. In this cell line, the combinational effect of Akt/mTOR inhibition with dasatinib was observed, as it was in the cell lines with intrinsic resistance.

We found that quercetin attenuated RTEC senescence induced by angiotensin II (AngII) in vitro and unilateral ureteral obstruction in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that mitochondrial abnormalities such as elevated reactive oxygen species, decreased membrane potential, and fragmentation and accumulation of mitochondrial mass, occurred in AngII-treated RTECs.

Pharmacological antagonism of SIRT1 in AngII-treated RTECs blocked the effects of quercetin on mitophagy and cellular senescence.

Senescence is generally regarded as a tumour suppressive process, both by preventing cancer cell proliferation and suppressing malignant progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease. It may also be a key effector mechanism of many types of anticancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapies, both directly and via bioactive molecules released by senescent cells that may stimulate an immune response. However, senescence may contribute to reduced patient resilience to cancer therapies and may provide a pathway for disease recurrence after cancer therapy.

A gain-of-function mutation in Fgr, a member of Src family kinases (SFKs), causes peripheral paw inflammation and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in Ali18 mice. The SFK inhibitor dasatinib was selected for administration to Ali18 mice daily for 2 weeks. Local inflammation and BMD were assessed by clinical scoring and computed tomography, respectively. Pilot studies in a small number of animals showed that dasatinib administration effectively suppressed the early phase of autoinflammation in Ali18 mice. Serial oral gavage of dasatinib to a group of Ali18 mice confirmed significant suppression of paw swelling with no side effects. Histological analysis revealed that abnormal proliferative bone marrow cells and inflammatory infiltration into the skin in the affected area were clearly reduced in the animals with dasatinib administration. Further, trabecular BMD in Ali18 long bones was restored to levels similar to that found in wild type mice.

In human PDAC cases, FGFR4 expression positively correlated with larger primary tumors and more advanced stages. Among eight PDAC cell lines, FGFR4 was expressed at the highest levels in PK-1 cells, in which single-nucleotide polymorphism G388R in FGFR4 was detected. For inhibition of autocrine/paracrine FGF19/FGFR4 signaling, we used BLU9931, a highly selective FGFR4 inhibitor. Inhibition of signal transduction through ERK, AKT, and STAT3 pathways by BLU9931 reduced proliferation in FGF19/FGFR4 signaling-activated PDAC cells. By contrast, BLU9931 did not alter stemness features, including stemness marker expression, anticancer drug resistance, and sphere-forming ability. However, BLU9931 inhibited cell invasion, in part, by downregulating membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 in FGF19/FGFR4 signaling-activated PDAC cells. Furthermore, downregulation of SIRT1 and SIRT6 by BLU9931 contributed to senescence induction, priming these cells for quercetin-induced death, a process termed senolysis. Thus, we propose that BLU9931 is a promising therapeutic agent in FGFR4-positive PDAC, especially when combined with senolysis (195/200).", relevance: "0.63"},

However, some patients suffer from low-grade side-effects that, in the long run, severely affect the quality of life and require treatment discontinuation due to toxicities. Fortunately, there are several therapeutic alternatives for these patients. Among them, the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (DAS), used as second-line treatment, has shown to be a valid option in patients with CP-CML after intolerance to prior IM. Patients and methods: Herein, we report on seven CP-CML patients who achieved a stable major molecular response (MMR) with IM-therapy, but were shifted to DAS treatment due to recurrent low-grade IM-intolerances (grades 1-2). Results and conclusion: All patients received conventional DAS treatment with a median daily dose of 83.3 mg. Treatment was well tolerated and side-effects were mild. In addition, after a median follow-up of 25 months (range=24-43 months) a deep molecular response (DMR) (either MR4 or MR4.5) was achieved in all patients after 24 months of treatment. This finding, although limited to a small cohort of CP-CML patients, supports the view that a therapy switch from IM to DAS induces a reduction of symptom burden, improves patient compliance and shows clinical efficacy in achieving and sustaining deep molecular responses.", relevance: "0.54"},

Here we evaluated whether and how PDE affects postnatal long bone growth in mouse offspring. Methods: Pregnant mice were injected subcutaneously with dexamethasone (1.2 mg/kg/day) every morning from gestational days (GD) 12-14. Femurs and tibias of 2-, 4-, 6-, and 12-week-old female offspring were harvested for histological, immunofluorescence, flow cytometric analysis, or microcomputed tomography (μCT) measurement. Results: PDE leads to impaired bone remodeling as well as decreased bone mass in the long bone of female mouse offspring. During postnatal bone growth, significant decrease of CD45-CD29+CD105+Sca-1+ bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and CD45-Nestin+ cells, loss of type H vessels, and increment of cellular senescence were found in metaphysis of long bone in mouse offspring after PDE. We further show that eliminating the excessive senescent cells with dasatinib (5 mg/kg/day) and quercetin (50 mg/kg/day) during GD 12-14 rescues the above toxic effect of PDE on the postnatal long bone growth in female mouse offspring.

Using a single drug to encounter cancer progression is generally ineffective. To improve the treatment outcome, multiple drugs of distinctive mechanisms but complementary anticancer activities (combination therapy) are often used to enhance antitumor efficacy and minimize the risk of acquiring drug resistance. We report here the synergistic effects of salinomycin (a polyether antibiotic) and dasatinib (a Src kinase inhibitor). Methods: Functionally, both drugs induce cell cycle arrest, intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) production, and apoptosis. We rationalized that an overlapping of the drug activities should offer an enhanced anticancer effect, either through vertical inhibition of the Src-STAT3 axis or horizontal suppression of multiple pathways. We determined the toxicity induced by the drug combination and studied the kinetics of iROS production by fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Using genomic and proteomic techniques, including RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western Blot, we subsequently identified the responsible pathways that contributed to the synergistic effects of the drug combination. Results: Compared to either drug alone, the drug combination showed enhanced potency against MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 human breast cancer (BC) cell lines and tumor spheroids. The drug combination induces both iROS generation and apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, following a 2-step kinetic profile. RNA-seq data revealed that the drug combination exhibited synergism through horizontal suppression of multiple pathways, possibly through a promotion of cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase via the estrogen-mediated S-phase entry pathway, and partially via the BRCA1 and DNA damage response pathway. Conclusion: Transcriptomic analyses revealed for the first time, that the estrogen-mediated S-phase entry pathway partially contributed to the synergistic effect of the drug combination. More importantly, our studies led to the discoveries of new potential therapeutic targets, such as E2F2, as well as a novel drug-induced targeting of estrogen receptor β (ESR2) approach for triple-negative breast cancer treatment, currently lacking of targeted therapies.", relevance: "0.53"},

The mechanism of quercetin against endothelial senescence is worth exploring. Methods: Quercetin (20 mg/kg/d) was administered to ApoE-/- mice intragastrically to evaluate the effectiveness of quercetin on atherosclerotic lesion in vivo. In vitro, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were used to assess the effect of quercetin on cellular senescence induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Transcriptome microarray and quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to study the pharmacological targets of quercetin. Results: ApoE-/- mice demonstrated obvious lipid deposition in arterial lumina, high level of serum sIcam-1 and IL-6, and high density of Vcam-1 and lower density of Sirt1 in aorta. Quercetin administration decreased lipid deposition in arterial lumina, serum sIcam-1, and IL-6 and Vcam-1 in aorta, while increased the density of Sirt1 in aorta of ApoE-/- mice. In vitro, quercetin (0.3, 1, or 3 μmol/L) decreased the expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and improved cell morphology of HAECs. And quercetin decreased the cellular apoptosis and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in dose-dependent manner, and decreased ROS generation simultaneously. Transcriptome microarray suggested 254 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs (110 mRNAs were upregulated and 144 mRNAs were downregulated) in HAECs after quercetin treatment (fold change > 1.5, P < 0 .05, Que vs Ox-LDL).

Methods: A population-based retrospective study including all patients (n=4238) diagnosed with CML in Ontario, Canada between 1986 and 2017 and and age-matched and sex-matched individuals who received healthcare but who did not have CML (controls: n=42 380). The cohort was divided into those entering before 2001 vs from 2001 onwards (when TKIs were introduced). We developed competing risks models to compare time-to-event in CML cases versus controls. We adjusted for baseline comorbidities and present subdistribution HRs and 95% CIs. The relationship between TKI use and MACE was assessed by logistic regression. Results: Before 2001 and from 2001 on, patients with CML had a higher crude incidence of MACE than patients without CML (19.8 vs 15.3 and 20.3 vs 12.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, patients with CML had a lower subdistribution hazard for MACE (0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76) before 2001; but from 2001, the adjusted subdistribution HR for MACE (1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.43) was similar to age-matched and sex-matched patients. The incidence (9.3 vs 13.8 per 1000 person-years) and subdistribution hazard for cardiovascular death (0.43, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.52) were lower in patients with CML than controls before 2001.

Objectives: This study aims to explain whether ferroptosis is a therapeutic strategy to AKI, and to explore the effect of QCT on AKI ferroptosis. Methods: NRK-52E cells and HK-2 cells were used for in vitro ferroptosis studies. Morphology of cells was detected by transmission electron microscopy. Lipid ROS was assayed using flow cytometry. In vivo, AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) or folic acid (FA). To explore the molecular mechanisms, RNA-sequence analysis was performed. Transwell was used to detect macrophage migration. Results: We discovered that quercetin (QCT), a natural flavonoid, inhibited ferroptosis in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. QCT blocked the typical morphologic changes of ferroptotic cells by reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid ROS and increasing the levels of glutathione (GSH). Moreover, QCT ameliorated AKI induced by I/R or FA. RNA-sequence analysis highlighted activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3), as it was the dominant one among all the 299 down-regulated genes by QCT. Knockdown of ATF3 could significantly increase the levels of SLC7A11, GPX4 and increased the cell viability. In addition, ferroptotic cells were found to be extremely pro-inflammatory by recruiting macrophages through CCL2, while QCT inhibited the chemotaxis of macrophages induced by ferroptosis in AKI.

It can occur with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but comparative real-world analyses on the incidence and complication rates are scarce. We retrospectively reviewed all cancer patients treated with TKI therapy at Mayo Clinic between January 2005 and December 2018 and had at least two ECGs (before and after TKI). For each TKI type, we determined the administration rate and incidence of QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation was defined as a corrected QT interval (by Fridericia formula) ≥450 ms in men and ≥470 ms in women. A total of 618 cancer patients were included with 902 TKI administrations, of which 654 (72.5%) were accounted for by pazopanib, sunitinib, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. QTc prolongation (any grade) was reported in 28.8%, most commonly with nilotinib (38.7%) and dasatinib (41.7%). A QTc interval ≥500 ms and a QTc increase ≥60 ms was documented in 46 and 63 administrations, respectively. Life-threatening toxicity was seen in 14 cases (5.4% of QTc prolongation cases) including VT in 9, SCD in 3 and TdP in two administrations. The response to QTc prolongation was: discontinuation in 68%, dose reduction in 13.5%, temporary hold in 8.1% and no action in 10.4%. In conclusion, QTc prolongation with TKI therapy is very common (∼1/3 of cases) and in 5% (1.7% overall) associated with life-threatening complications.

Language of publications was restricted in English and Chinese. Eligibility criteria: Prospective and retrospective comparative studies were included. Data extraction and synthesis: Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Quality of studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaborations tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analysis was performed by comparing different types of TKIs. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four cohort studies enrolling 536 patients were included.

Developing adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is promising in helping to achieve this goal as it can bring In Vitro testing into toxicity measurement and understanding. To explore the toxic mechanism underlying environmental chemicals via the AOP approach, an integration of adequate experimental data with systems biology understanding is preferred. Here, we describe a novel method to develop reliable and sensible AOPs that relies on chemical-gene interactions, toxicity pathways, molecular regulations, phenotypes, and outcomes information obtained from comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Using Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a highly studied chemical as a stressor, we identified the pivotal IPA toxicity pathways, the molecular initiating event (MIE), and candidate key events (KEs) to structure AOPs in the liver and lung, respectively. Further, we used the corresponding CTD information of multiple typical AHR-ligands, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzoparadioxin (TCDD), valproic acid, quercetin, and particulate matter, to validate our AOP networks. Our approach is likely to speed up AOP development as providing a time- and cost-efficient way to collect all fragmented bioinformation in published studies.

We evaluated the 1-year cost-effectiveness of TKI initiation with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib among a hypothetical cohort of incident patients with CML from a US payers perspective. Methods: We constructed a decision analytic model to assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, net monetary benefit, and incremental cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. We used published studies and data from the IBM Watson Health MarketScan database for model parameters. To calculate TKI costs, we used the 2018 Federal Supply Schedule estimates for generic imatinib and branded second-generation TKIs. We evaluated cost-effectiveness under various willingness-to-pay thresholds. We accounted for uncertainty with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: In the base-case analysis, imatinib was favored over dasatinib and nilotinib at a lower cost per QALY gained. Imatinib remained the favored strategy after 1-way variations in TKI costs, TKI switching, QALYs, adverse event risk, and CML progression. When we assessed model uncertainty with prespecified parameter distributions, imatinib was cost-saving compared with dasatinib in 40% of 100 0000 simulations and was favored over all simulations compared with nilotinib. First-line treatment with second-generation TKIs was cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a $200 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.

There are many cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) caused by chemotherapeutic agents that have been reported. However, few reports focus on the combination of chemotherapeutic agents that induce acute pancreatitis. This article aims to retrospectively analyze a case of DIP and to explore the relationship between chemotherapeutic agents and acute pancreatitis. Patient concerns: Here, we report a 35-year-old Chinese female patient who was diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia with BCR/ABL expression. After induction chemotherapy of daunorubicin and cytarabine, bone marrow aspiration showed: Acute myeloid leukemia-not relieved (AML-NR). Then the regimen of homoharringtonine, cytarabine and dasatinib was started. The patient developed abdominal pain on the 14th day of chemotherapy. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum amylase (AMY) and lipase (LIPA). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a swollen pancreas with blurred edges and thickened left prerenal fascia. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed as DIP by the symptoms of upper abdominal pain and the change of CT images. Other common causes of AP were excluded meanwhile. Interventions: The chemotherapy was stopped immediately. And after fasting, fluid infusion and inhibiting the secretion of the pancreas, the symptoms were relieved. Outcomes: DIP relapsed when the regimen of aclacinomycin + cytarabine + G-CSF + dasatinib regimen (G-CSF (400ug/day, day 1 to 15), cytarabine (30 mg/day, day 2 to 15), aclacinomycin (20 mg/day, day 2 to 5)and dasatinib (140 mg/day, continuously)) was given, and was recovered after treatment for AP was performed.

However, three of the five BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, increase the risk of developing arterial thrombosis. Prior investigations reported that nilotinib and ponatinib affect the endothelium, but the mechanisms by which they exert their toxic effects are still unclear. The impact of dasatinib and bosutinib on endothelial cells has been poorly investigated. Here, we aimed to provide an in vitro homogenous evaluation of the effects of BCR-ABL TKIs on the endothelium, with a special focus on the type of cell death to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the potential cytotoxic effects of BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib and ponatinib on endothelial cells. We tested the five BCR-ABL TKIs at three concentrations on human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). This study highlights the endothelial toxicity of ponatinib and provides insights about the mechanisms by which it affects endothelial cell viability. Ponatinib induced apoptosis and necrosis of HUVECs after 72 h. Dasatinib affected endothelial cells in vitro by inhibiting their proliferation and decreased wound closure as soon as 24 h of treatment and even at infra-therapeutic dose (0.005 µM). Comparatively, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib had little impact on endothelial cells at therapeutic concentrations. They did not induce apoptosis nor necrosis, even after 72 h of treatment but they inhibited HUVEC proliferation. Overall, this study reports various effects of BCR-ABL TKIs on endothelial cells and suggests that ponatinib and dasatinib induce arterial thrombosis through endothelial dysfunction.", relevance: "0.29"},

To overcome this risk, a variety of approaches have been developed to eliminate the remaining undifferentiated hPSCs via selective cell death induction. Our study seeks to identify natural flavonoids that are more potent than quercetin (QC), to selectively induce hPSC death. Upon screening in-house flavonoids, luteolin (LUT) is found to be more potent than QC to eliminate hPSCs in a p53-dependent manner, but not hPSC-derived smooth muscle cells or perivascular progenitor cells. Particularly, treating human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes with LUT efficiently eliminates the residual hESCs and only results in marginal effects on cardiomyocyte (CM) functions, as determined by calcium influx. Considering the technical limitations of isolating CMs due to a lack of exclusive surface markers at the end of differentiation, LUT treatment is a promising approach to minimize teratoma formation risk.", relevance: "0.29"},

Nevertheless, patients receiving TKIs report chronic adverse events such as fatigue, edema, and muscle cramps, which lead to a decrease in their quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the QoL and symptom burden in patients receiving original imatinib, generic imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. Patients and methods: A total of 121 patients with CML who received TKIs for at least 3 months were enrolled in the study. The QoL was assessed with the Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (QLQ-CML24) modules. The symptom burden was assessed with MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) and EORTC QLQ-CML24.

Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 344 children with ALL younger than 17 years old at diagnosis identified in pediatric department of Peking University Peoples Hospital. The children were divided into three groups: conventional chemotherapy group, imatinib group and dasatinib group. Height was expressed as standard deviation score(HtSDS). In the three groups, we compared the HtSDS and △HtSDS at the start of treatment and during follow-up period and also compared the adult height and median parental height(MPH). We further compared the HtSDS classified by age and gender in imatinib group. At last, univariate analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors on the deceleration of height growth by imatinib. Results: There were 298 children in conventional chemotherapy group, 39 in imatinib group and 7 in dasatinib group. In imatinib group, the mean HtSDS of children at follow-up time was significantly lower than that at the start of treatment (P < 0.05), regardless of age and gender. In imatinib group, the decrease of HtSDS in girls was more obvious than in boys(P = 0.031). The HtSDS gradually decreased in the first and the second year in imatinib group.

Multivariate analysis showed that the HtSDS at the start of imatinib was negatively correlated with severe growth impairment on imatinib therapy. The HtSDS in dasatinib group and conventional chemotherapy group maintained a high degree of consistency. Conclusion: Imatinib can affect growth velocity in children with ALL, regardless of age and gender. With the discontinuation of imatinib, the inhibitory effect will not continue.

The RIST treatment protocol has a multimodal metronomic therapy design combining molecular-targeted drugs (Rapamycin and Dasatinib) with chemotherapy backbone (Irinotecan and Temozolomide), which is currently verified in a phase II clinical trial (NCT01467986). With the availability of novel and more potent ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors, we expect to improve the RIST combination therapy. By comparing the IC50 values of Torin-1, Torin-2, AZD3147 and PP242 we established that only Torin-2 inhibited cell viability of all three MycN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines tested at nanomolar concentration. Single treatment of both mTOR inhibitors induced a significant G1 cell cycle arrest and combination treatment with Dasatinib reduced the expression of cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 or increased the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21. The combinatorial index depicted for both mTOR inhibitors a synergistic effect with Dasatinib. Interestingly, compared to Rapamycin, the combination treatment with Torin-2 resulted in a broader mTOR pathway inhibition as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of AKT (Thr308, Ser473), 4E-BP (Ser65), and S6K (Thr389). Furthermore, substituting Rapamycin in the modified multimodal RIST protocol with Torin-2 reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis despite a significant lower Torin-2 drug concentration applied. The efficacy of nanomolar concentrations may significantly reduce unwanted immunosuppression associated with Rapamycin. However, at this point we cannot rule out that Torin-2 has increased toxicity due to its potency in more complex systems. Nonetheless, our results suggest that including Torin-2 as a substitute for Rapamycin in the RIST protocol may represent a valid option to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for relapsed or treatment-refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.", relevance: "0.28"},

Since the 1960s E. histolytica infection has been successfully treated with metronidazole. However, drawbacks to metronidazole therapy exist, including adverse effects, a long treatment course, and the need for an additional drug to prevent cyst-mediated transmission. E. histolytica possesses a kinome with approximately 300-400 members, some of which have been previously studied as potential targets for the development of amoebicidal drug candidates. However, while these efforts have uncovered novel potent inhibitors of E. histolytica kinases, none have resulted in approved drugs. In this study we took the alternative approach of testing a set of twelve previously FDA-approved antineoplastic kinase inhibitors against E. histolytica trophozoites in vitro. This resulted in the identification of dasatinib, bosutinib, and ibrutinib as amoebicidal agents at low-micromolar concentrations. Next, we utilized a recently developed computational tool to identify twelve additional drugs with human protein target profiles similar to the three initial hits. Testing of these additional twelve drugs led to the identification of ponatinib, neratinib, and olmutinib were identified as highly potent, with EC50 values in the sub-micromolar range. All of these six drugs were found to kill E. histolytica trophozoites as rapidly as metronidazole. Furthermore, ibrutinib was found to kill the transmissible cyst stage of the model organism E. invadens. Ibrutinib thus possesses both amoebicidal and cysticidal properties, in contrast to all drugs used in the current therapeutic strategy.

To date, there are no reliable means to predict the cardiotoxicity of TKIs under development. The present study assessed the usual variants of genes to determine the molecular targets of TKIs associated with heart failure (HF). Gene or gene products affected by TKIs were assessed using the Drug Gene Interaction Database. These genes were investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets associated with HF at a genome-wide significant level (P<1×10-5). Subsequently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reached the established GWAS threshold (P<5×10-8) were investigated for genome-wide significance. Based on a threshold score of 3, nine gene loci yielded associations according to their biological function using RegulomeDB. Finally, comprehensive functional analysis of SNPs was performed using bioinformatics databases to identify potential drug targets. Using rSNPBase, rs7115242, rs143160639 and rs870064 were found to interfere with proximal transcription regulation, while rs7115242, rs143160639 and rs117153772 were involved in distal regulation, and most SNPs participated in post-transcriptional RNA binding protein-mediated regulation. rs191188930 on platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α was associated with numerous TKI drugs, including sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, dasatinib and nilotinib.

The results showed that quercetin treatment can disaggregate moPrP fibrils and lead to the formation of the proteinase-sensitive amorphous aggregates. Furthermore, quercetin-bound fibrils can reduce the membrane disruption of erythrocytes. Consequently, quercetin-bound fibrils cause less oxidative stress, and are less cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells.

Aim of the study: To our knowledge, no data reveal the combination between in-vivo anti-inflammatory and toxicological studies of EAAE. For this purpose, the aim of this study is to evaluate the biological activity cited above and assess its safety. Material and methods: Anti-inflammatory activity was undergone using carrageenan-induced paw edema and croton oil-induced ear edema. The acute and sub-acute toxicity were conducted following the OECD guidelines 423 and 407, respectively. Phytochemical identification was carried out using HPLC-DAD-MS. Quantitative evaluation of polyphenols; flavonoids and antioxidant activity of EAAE were also determined. Results: Oral administration of EAAE (250 and 500 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the edema induced by carrageenan. Administration of EAAE dosed at 250 and 500 mg/kg exhibited efficacy in reducing edema induced by croton oil. The acute administration of EAAE at doses of 2000 and 5000 mg/kg did not cause any mortality or adverse effects indicating that the LD50 is above 5000 mg/kg. The prolonged administration of EAAE (500 and 1000 mg/kg) showed a significant reduction in triglycerides levels in male and female rats whereas no significant changes in other biochemical and hematological parameters were observed.

Recent drug discoveries have opened up new options for drug combinations, which is a concept used in other areas for preventing drug resistance. Two of these are (I) Axitinib, which inhibits the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL1, a main source of drug resistance, and (II) Asciminib, which has been developed as an allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, targeting an entirely different binding site, and as such does not compete for binding with other drugs. These drugs offer new treatment options. Methods: We measured the proliferation of KCL-22 cells exposed to imatinib-dasatinib, imatinib-asciminib and dasatinib-asciminib combinations and calculated combination index graphs for each case. Moreover, using the median-effect equation we calculated how much axitinib can reduce the growth advantage of T315I mutant clones in combination with available drugs. In addition, we calculated how much the total drug burden could be reduced by combinations using asciminib and other drugs, and evaluated which mutations such combinations might be sensitive to. Results: Asciminib had synergistic interactions with imatinib or dasatinib in KCL-22 cells at high degrees of inhibition. Interestingly, some antagonism between asciminib and the other drugs was present at lower degrees on inhibition. Simulations revealed that asciminib may allow for dose reductions, and its complementary resistance profile could reduce the risk of mutation based resistance. Axitinib, however, had only a minor effect on T315I growth advantage. Conclusions: Given how asciminib combinations were synergistic in vitro, our modelling suggests that drug combinations involving asciminib should allow for lower total drug doses, and may result in a reduced spectrum of observed resistance mutations. On the other hand, a combination involving axitinib was not shown to be useful in countering drug resistance.", relevance: "0.25"},

Subsequently, more expensive second-generation TKIs with varying selectivity profiles have been approved. Population-based studies are needed to evaluate the real-world utilization of TKI therapies, particularly given their escalating costs and recommendations for maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the utilization patterns of first-line TKIs, overall and by specific agent, among elderly CML patients in the United States, and the cost implications. METHODS: CML patients aged 65 years and older at diagnosis between 2007 and 2015 were identified from population-based cancer registries in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. The percentage of CML patients receiving imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib within the first year of diagnosis was calculated along with time to first-line treatment initiation. Bivariate comparisons and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with TKI initiation. Average monthly patient responsibility, including patient out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, stratified by Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) status were also calculated. RESULTS: Among the 1,589 CML patients included, receipt of any TKI within 1 year of diagnosis increased from 66.2% to 78.9%. In 2015, the distribution of first-line TKI therapies was 41.3% imatinib, 28.3% dasatinib, and 9.3% nilotinib. Almost 60% of patients initiated TKI treatment within 3 months of diagnosis. Multivariable analysis indicated that TKI use in the first year was lower among the very elderly (aged > 75 years vs. 65-69 years: HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.63-0.83), patients with more comorbidities (Hierarchical Condition Category risk score > 2 vs. HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.88), and patients ineligible for LIS (HR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.65-0.87). Average monthly patient OOP cost was significantly lower for LIS-eligible versus LIS-ineligible patients: imatinib (2016: $12 vs. $487), dasatinib (2016: $34 vs. $557), and nilotinib (2016: $1 vs. $526). CONCLUSIONS: TKI use has increased significantly since 2007. While imatinib remained the most frequently prescribed first-line agent, by 2015 newer TKIs represented one third of the market share. Utilization patterns indicated persistent age, comorbidity, and financial barriers. TKI use is indicated for long-term therapy, and increased adoption of newer, more expensive agents raises concerns about the sustained affordability of CML treatment, particularly among unsubsidized patients.

As a natural medicine, Scutellaria barbata D. Don (SBD) has shown impressive antitumour activity in various cancers. Thus, SBD may become a potential drug in adverse-risk AML treatment. This study aimed to screen the key targets of SBD in adverse-risk AML using the drug-biomarker interaction model through bioinformatics and network pharmacology methods. First, the adverse-risk AML-related critical biomarkers and targets of SBD active ingredient were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and several pharmacophore matching databases. Next, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and topological analysis and pathway enrichment were used to screen key targets and main pathways of intervention of SBD in adverse-risk AML. Finally, molecular docking was implemented for key target verification.

However, long-term TKI exposure has been associated with persistent adverse events (AEs) which negatively impact on quality of life (QoL) and have the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. In clinical practice, TKI dose reduction is usually considered to reduce AEs and improve QoL, but dose optimization could have also another aim, i.e., the achievement and maintenance of cytogenetic and molecular responses. While therapy cessation appeared as a safe option for about half of the patients achieving an optimal response, no systematic assessment of long-term TKI dose de-escalation has been made.

We previously established a model of CSCs by culturing mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) for four weeks in the presence of a conditioned medium (CM) of cancer cell lines, which functioned as the tumor microenvironment. Based on this methodology of developing CSCs from miPSCs, we assessed the risk of 110 non-mutagenic chemical compounds, most of which are known as inhibitors of cytoplasmic signaling pathways, as potential carcinogens. We treated miPSCs with each compound for one week in the presence of a CM of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. However, one-week period was too short for the CM to convert miPSCs into CSCs. Consequently, PDO325901 (MEK inhibitor), CHIR99021 (GSK-3β inhibitor) and Dasatinib (Abl, Src and c-Kit inhibitor) were found to confer miPSCs with the CSC phenotype in one week. The tumor cells that survived exhibited stemness markers, spheroid formation and tumorigenesis in Balb/c nude mice. Hence, we concluded that the three signal inhibitors accelerated the conversion of miPSCs into CSCs. Similarly to our previous study, we found that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was upregulated in the CSCs. Herein, we focused on the expression of relative genes after the treatment with these three inhibitors. Our results demonstrated an increased expression of pik3ca, pik3cb, pik3r5 and pik3r1 genes indicating class IA PI3K as the responsible signaling pathway. Hence, AKT phosphorylation was found to be up-regulated in the obtained CSCs. Inhibition of Erk1/2, tyrosine kinase, and/or GSK-3β was implied to be involved in the enhancement of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in the undifferentiated cells, resulting in the sustained stemness, and subsequent conversion of miPSCs into CSCs in the tumor microenvironment.", relevance: "0.24"},

ARPE-19 cells or quercetin enriched cultures pre-loaded with rhodopsin-rich POS isolated from bovine retinas were irradiated with green light to photobleach rhodopsin, and subsequently with blue light. Survival of cells was determined by MTT assay and propidium iodide staining. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed by JC-1 staining. Protein hydroperoxides, formed by photosensitized oxidation, mediated by RPBP, were analyzed in cells and in a model system with bovine serum albumin (BSA), using the coumarin boronic acid fluorogenic probe.

Photoreactivity of POS with and without quercetin was analyzed by EPR oximetry and EPR spin trapping. Cytotoxicity measurements and MMP analyses confirmed that supplementation with quercetin protected ARPE-19 cells against photic stress mediated by rhodopsin-rich POS. Quercetin significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of RPBP-mediated stress on POS phagocytosis and the RPBP ability to photooxidize cellular proteins or BSA.

This study sought to determine the DOX-induced toxicity in the ovary and uterus and the preventive effects of quercetin (QCT) and vitamin E (Vit.E). Female rats were divided into six groups as follows: control, QCT (20 mg/kg), Vit.E (200 mg/kg), DOX (accumulative 15 mg/kg), DOX/QCT, and DOX/Vit.E. After 3 weeks, the toxicity of DOX in ovarian and uterine tissues and the potential palliative effects of QCT and Vit.E were evaluated by histopathological-stereological methods. The findings indicate a dramatic decline in the number of ovarian follicles (p < 0.001), ovarian and its associated structures volume, the volume of the uterus, its layers, and related structures (p < 0.05). Coadministration of QCT and Vit.E with DOX-treated rats demonstrated an alleviative effect on most of the studied parameters. Nevertheless, few adverse effects were recognized concerning these antioxidants administration (p < 0.05).

The current study sought to determine the palliative effects of quercetin (Q) and vitamin E (Vit.E) on some of the uterines metabolism-related factors in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and compare them with the effects of estrogen. Materials and methods: Sixty-four rats were divided into eight groups. OVX animals were treated with Q (15 mg/kg/day), Vit.E (60 mg/kg/day), E2 (10 µg/kg/day), and Q (7.5 mg/kg/day) + Vit.E (30 mg/kg/day) for 10 weeks. Glucose and adiponectin were measured using glucose oxidase and ELISA, respectively. Furthermore, the present study investigated the alterations in the expression of AdipoR1, nesfatin1, and GluT4 genes. Results: Antioxidants suppress the weight gain of OVX animals. Also, Q, Vit.E, and E2 cause a significant decline in glucose and adiponectin levels (p-value < .05). Finally, the expression of AdipoR1, nesfatin1, and GLUT4 genes was significantly increased in treated OVX rats uterus.

This study was mainly aimed at investigating the effects of A. cepa extract (ACE) enriched in polyphenols on hyperlipidemia Sprague-Dawley (SD) experiment rat models. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum and liver were measured using ELISA kits. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) technique was used to observe the liver and the aortic arch pathology. Moreover, western blotting (WB) method was applied to analyze LDL receptor (LDLR) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGCR) in liver. As a result, quercetin (2.42 mg/g DW) and isoquercitrin (4.60 mg/g DW) were the main constituents of ACE using HPLC analysis. Furthermore, ACE reduced the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and MDA, and increased HDL levels and elevated SOD activity both in serum and liver in hyperlipidemic SD rats (p < .05). HE results showed that liver fat drops of the rats in ACE group were obviously decreased, and the lipid and foam cells of the aortic arch of the rats in ACE group were markedly ameliorated. WB results showed that ACE promoted the degradation of HMGCR and increased LDLR expression in liver (p < .05). In conclusion, ACE alleviated hyperlipidemia with downregulation of HMGCR and upregulation of LDLR. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Atherosclerosis, a major cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed countries. Moreover, accumulating data indicate that, during atherosclerosis development, hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor. To date, hyperlipidemia is mainly treated with hyperlipidemic agents including statins, in spite of the side effects and poor tolerance in some patients. In addition, Allium cepa is a medicinal and edible plant. Furthermore, A. cepa is used for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia-related diseases such as atherosclerosis in the folk. But the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In fact, this research showed that A. cepa extract (ACE) alleviated hyperlipidemia with downregulation of HMGCR and upregulation of LDLR, suggesting that ACE might be a potential option for hyperlipidemia as non-statin lipid-lowering agent.", relevance: "0.23"},

Discontinuation of TKIs is safe and is associated with the successful achievement of treatment-free remission (TFR) for some patients. Objective: To evaluate molecular recurrence (MRec) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after TKI discontinuation for US patients with CML. Design, setting, and participants: The Life After Stopping TKIs (LAST) study was a prospective single-group nonrandomized clinical trial that enrolled 172 patients from 14 US academic medical centers from December 18, 2014, to December 12, 2016, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Participants were adults with chronic-phase CML whose disease was well controlled with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib. Statistical analysis was performed from August 13, 2019, to March 23, 2020. Intervention: Discontinuation of TKIs. Main outcomes and measures: Molecular recurrence, defined as loss of major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 International Scale ratio >0.1%) by central laboratory testing, and PROs (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive tests) were monitored. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was performed on samples with undetectable BCR-ABL1 by standard real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Results: Of 172 patients, 89 were women (51.7%), and the median age was 60 years (range, 21-86 years). Of 171 patients evaluable for molecular analysis, 112 (65.5%) stayed in major molecular response, and 104 (60.8%) achieved TFR. Undetectable BCR-ABL1 by either ddPCR or RQ-PCR at the time of TKI discontinuation (hazard ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.99-6.50; P < .001) and at 3 months (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.07-11.1; P < .001) was independently associated with MRec. Molecular recurrence for patients with detectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR was 50.0% (14 of 28), undetectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR but detectable by ddPCR was 64.3% (36 of 56), and undetectable BCR-ABL1 by both ddPCR and RQ-PCR was 10.3% (9 of 87) (P ≤ .001). Of the 112 patients in TFR at 12 months, 90 (80.4%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue, 39 (34.8%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in depression, 98 (87.5%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in diarrhea, 24 (21.4%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in sleep disturbance, and 5 (4.5%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in pain interference. Restarting a TKI resulted in worsening of PROs. Conclusions and relevance: In this study, TKI discontinuation was safe, and 60.8% of patients remained in TFR. Discontinuation of TKIs was associated with improvements in PROs. These findings should assist patients and physicians in their decision-making regarding discontinuation of TKIs. Detectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR or ddPCR at the time of TKI discontinuation was associated with higher risk of MRec; clinical application of this finding should be confirmed in other studies.

ASXL1 was originally identified as tumor suppressor gene, in which loss of function causes myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ASXL1 mutations are common and associated with disease progression in myeloid malignancies including MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, and similarly in CML. In MDS, ASXL1 mutations have been associated with poor prognosis; however, the impact of ASXL1 mutations in CML has not been well described. A 31-year-old male was diagnosed as CML-chronic phase (CP). Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 187,200/µL, with asymptomatic splenomegaly. Blast count was 5.0% in peripheral blood and 7.3% in bone marrow. There was no additional chromosomal abnormality except for t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) by chromosomal analysis. At onset, the Sokal score was 1.4, indicating high risk. The patient received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, comprising nilotinib ∼600 mg/day, bosutinib ∼600 mg/day, ponatinib ∼45 mg/day, and dasatinib ∼100 mg/day. Nevertheless, after 1.5 years of continuous TKI therapy, the best outcome was a hematological response. Although additional chromosomal aberrations and ABL1 kinase mutations were analyzed repeatedly before and during TKI therapy, known genetic abnormalities were not detected. Thereafter, the patient underwent bone marrow transplantation from an HLA 7/8 matched unrelated donor (HLA-Cw 1 locus mismatch, graft-versus-host direction). The patient achieved neutrophil engraftment, 18 days after transplantation, leading to complete remission with an undetectable level of BCR-ABL1 mRNA. The patient, however, died from graft-versus-host disease and thrombotic microangiopathy after 121 days. Gene sequence analysis of his CML cell before stem cell transplantation revealed ASXL1 mutations. Physiologically, ASXL1 contributes to epigenetic regulation. In the CML-CP patient in this case report, ASXL1 mutation conferred resistance to TKI through obscure resistance mechanisms. Even though a molecular mechanism for TKI resistance in ASXL1 mutation in CML has remained obscure, epigenetic modulation is a plausible mode of CML disease progression. The clinical impact including prognosis of ASXL1 for CML is underscored. And the treatment strategy of CML with ASXL1 mutation has not been established.

Diabetes and obesity can lead to the accumulation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and other symptoms of AD through several pathways, including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines dysregulation, and vascular impairment. Currently, the use of polyphenols has been expanded in animal models and in-vitro studies because of their comparatively negligible adverse effects. Among them, quercetin (QT) is one of the most abundant polyphenolic flavonoids, which is present in fruits and vegetables and displays many biological, health-promoting effects in a wide range of diseases. The low bioavailability and poor solubility of QT have also led researchers to make various QT-involved nanoparticles (NPs) to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we review significant molecular mechanisms induced by diabetes and obesity that increase AD pathogenesis. Then, we summarize in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence regarding the anti-Alzheimer, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects of QT. Finally, QT in pure and combination form using NPs has been suggested as a promising therapeutic agent for future studies.", relevance: "0.22"},

Genetic mutations can lead to many NDs. Nevertheless, neurodegeneration can also take place due to several biological processes. The pathogenesis of several NDs including Alzheimers (AD), Parkinsons (PD), and Huntingtons (HD) diseases are associated with oxidative stress (OS). In order to maintain the normal functions of neurons, lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are important, since their increased levels can cause neuronal cell death. It has been found that OS-mediated neurodegeneration involves a number of events including mitochondrial dysfunction, Ca2+ overload, and excitotoxicity. A growing number of studies are suggesting the benefit of using polyphenols for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, in order to treat most of the NDs, synthetic drugs are extensively used which are found to exert side effects in the course of the treatment. There is mounting evidence that researchers have identified several naturally-occurring chemical compounds in plants, which are used for the management of NDs. Overall, polyphenolic phytochemicals are safer in nature and have negligible side effects.

Imatinib, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI, was introduced into clinical practice in the early 2000s. In the following years, the so-called second-generation TKIs (2GTKIs)-dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib were approved, initially for patients resistant to imatinib, and subsequently for front-line treatment. With multiple TKIs available, selection of first-line therapy is challenging. CML risk, patient characteristics and potential toxicities of different TKIs play a fundamental role, in particular when deciding between imatinib and 2GTKIs as frontline treatment. So, when deciding front-line therapy for a patient with CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP), clinicians must consider both the long-term outcomes, such as overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as safety, tolerance and possible treatment discontinuation. This paper offers a practical algorithmic approach for the sequential use of commercially available TKIs in patients with CML-CP along with the data available in the literature.", relevance: "0.22"},

In this paper, the clinicopathological features and prognostic factors of PDGFRA-mutant GIST are investigated to provide more data for its understanding and treatment. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was used to collect the medical records of patients with GIST who underwent surgical resection in Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University from January 2015 to August 2019. Patients with PDGFRA-mutant GIST were enrolled, and those with synonymous PDGFRA mutations, non-tumor-related deaths, and lack of clinicopathological data were excluded. The clinicopathological data were collected and the risk factors associated with prognosis were analyzed. Results: Among the enrolled 59 patients, there were 41 males (69.5%) and 18 females (30.5%) with the median age of 60 (25-79) years. All tumors originated from the stomach. The tumor size was 5 (3-7) cm, and the mitotic count was 2 (1-4)/50 high-power fields (HPF). According to the modified NIH risk stratification, 8 cases were classified as very low risk (13.6%), 25 cases as low risk (42.4%), 14 cases as moderate risk (23.7%), and 12 cases as high risk (20.3%). There were 7 cases of exon 12 mutation and 52 cases of exon 18 mutation (including 36 cases of D842V mutation). A comparison of clinicopathological features between the D842V mutation group and the non-D842V mutation group showed no statistically significant difference (all P>0.05). During a median follow-up of 21 (0-59) months, the 1- and 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates of all the patients were 96.6% and 91.5%, respectively. There were 8 cases of recurrence and 3 cases of death. Six GIST patients with D842V mutation had tumor recurrence after operation, of whom 4 cases achieved varying degrees of tumor remission after being treated with dasatinib or avapritinib. Log-rank analysis showed that the overall survival (OS) of male was better than that of female (100% vs. 83.3%, P=0.046), but there was no significant difference in OS among patients with different risk grades (P=0.057). The RFS and OS of patients with D842V mutation and non-D842V mutation, exon 12 and exon 18 mutation were similar (all P>0.05). Univariate Cox analysis showed that RFS was associated with gender (P=0.010), tumor size (P=0.042), mitotic count (P=0.003), and the modified NIH risk stratification (P=0.042), while multivariate analysis revealed that higher risk grade was an independent risk factor for recurrence of PDGFRA-mutant GIST (HR=12.796, 95%CI: 1.326-123.501, P=0.028). Gender was an independent factor for recurrence, and the risk of recurrence in males was lower than that in females (HR=0.154, 95%CI: 0.028-0.841, P=0.031).

Serious and frequent, and in part cumulative long-term toxicities, have led to a reevaluation of the role of 2G-TKIs in first-line therapy. Generic imatinib is the current most cost-effective first-line therapy in the chronic phase. A change of treatment is recommended when intolerance cannot be ameliorated or molecular milestones are not reached. Patient comorbidities and contraindications of all TKIs must be considered.

Main outcome: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm. Randomisation: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home). Blinding (masking): This is an open-label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim n°3 and final) will be performed successively.

He and his partner expressed their desire to have a child. We recommended planning the pregnancy after the achievement of major molecular response and completion of TKI therapy because we could not promise complete safety of the fetus, However, he and his partner insisted on starting the TKI therapy immediately and planned the pregnancy during the therapy. The patient was started on nilotinib 600mg/body. CCyR, MMR, and CMR were achieved in 3, 8, and 12 months, respectively. The patients partner got pregnant when he had been on TKI therapy for 15 months, and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Since many patients with CMLcan live for a long time after receiving TKI therapy, the quality of life of these patients is more important. Even if the percentage of patients with CML who are under 50 years of age is approximately 30%, the safety information of TKI with respect to pregnancy is unsatisfactory. Doctors struggle to address the problems of the patients wish of childbearing, priority of TKI therapy, and fetal risks of the treatment. Although only a few cases of pregnancy and delivery of the partners of male patients with CML treated with TKI have been reported, all cases showed healthy childbirth and normal child growth. Our experience also showed that the partner of a male patient with CML treated with TKI became pregnant and delivered a healthy baby.", relevance: "0.22"},

However, adherence to these therapeutic approaches is poor. On the other hand, synthetic drugs used for obesity control are plagued by adverse effects. Despite these failures, adipose tissue is still an attractive therapeutic target for novel molecules, and thus, the characterisation of new and safer anti-obesity drugs is of significant interest. For this reason, in recent years, phenolic constituents of diverse plants have drawn much attention due to their health-promoting properties, opening new research lines related to brown adipose tissue activation and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. The goal is to increase energy expenditure levels through thermogenic activity activation by multiple factors, like polyphenols. The suggested mechanisms by which polyphenols can modulate thermogenesis include Nor-epinephrine/Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (NE/COMT) inhibition, PPARγ co-activator alpha (PGC-1α)-dependent pathways activation, and mitochondrial biogenesis, among others. Although polyphenols such as quercetin, catechins, chrysin, luteolin, curcumin, resveratrol, gallic acid, and lignans have shown a positive effect on Non-Shivering Thermogenesis and WAT browning, most of them have only been active in murine models or in vitro systems, and their reproducibility in humans has to be proved. Probably in the future, an approach that includes these compounds as part of the nutritional regimen in conjunction with physical exercise, pharmacological and surgical therapy, would allow modulating a pathophysiological mechanism that is still elusive.", relevance: "0.22"},

In recent years, research findings on the benefits of anti-oxidant foods and supplements have been employed in counter-acting both oxidative stress as well as inflammation in order to reduce the adverse side effects of anti-retroviral therapy. One such natural flavonoid which possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties is quercetin. This study investigated the effect of quercetin in overcoming the side effects incurred due to rilpivirine administration. The results show substantial reduction in the accumulation of triglyceride levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner for adipose cells treated with either rilpivirine or quercetin alone and in combination, as evidenced by morphological pictures and quantitative measurement of triglycerides throughout the differentiation process. Levels of inflammatory markers such as resistin and IL-8 were increased as compared to the untreated cells. No significant changes in leptin were observed on treatment of adipose cells with rilpivirine alone and its levels were almost comparable to control. Levels of oxidative markers like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione were also decreased. Treatment with quercetin showed a decrease in the inflammatory status and an increase in the oxidative status of adipose cells, thereby exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, further assessment of lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function in patients administered with rilpivirine-based regimes is advisable considering that totally neutral effects of rilpivirine on lipid homeostasis cannot be anticipated from the current study in vitro. It is concluded that rilpivirine causes an anti-adipogenic and pro-inflammatory response pattern but only at high concentrations, whereas quercetin has been observed to decrease inflammation and restore the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes.", relevance: "0.22"},

Quercetin (Que) is a kind of flavonoid that can protect many tissues from the toxic effect of heavy metals. Although many studies have explored the adverse effects of cadmium on rats and other animals, the mechanism of Cd-induced testicular autophagy and the antagonistic effect of Que on cadmium remain unclear. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Cd, Que or Cd, and Que supplements to explore the mechanisms of Que-alleviated testis injury caused by Cd exposure. The rat body weight and relative testicular weight were measured. Morphological changes in testes and indices of oxidative stress were also examined. The expression levels of autophagy-related genes were detected as well. Results showed that Cd decreased the rat body weight and relative testicular weight and induced pathological changes in testes. Conversely, Que alleviated these changes. We also found that Cd increased the malondialdehyde content and decreased the contents of total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione. Moreover, the protein expression levels of P62 and LC3-II increased under Cd exposure conditions. Conversely, Que obviously alleviated these toxic activities induced by Cd. Overall, this study showed that Cd accumulated in rat testes, leading to oxidative stress and autophagy. Que can reduce cadmium toxicity by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting autophagy.

Pharmacological compounds that stabilize the visual receptor rhodopsin and modulate the cellular pathways triggering death of photoreceptors could avert this pathology. Interestingly, flavonoids can modulate the cellular processes, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis, that are activated during retinal degeneration. As we found previously, flavonoids also bind directly to unliganded rod opsin, enhancing its folding, stability, and regeneration. In addition, flavonoids stimulate rhodopsin gene expression. Thus, we evaluated the effect of two main dietary flavonoids, quercetin and myricetin, in ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 4 -/- /retinol dehydrogenase 8 -/- and wild-type BALB/c mice susceptible to light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Using in vivo imaging, such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and histologic assessment of retinal morphology, we found that treatment with these flavonoids prior to light insult remarkably protected retina from deterioration and preserved its function. Using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, we detected these flavonoids in the eye upon their intraperitoneal administration. The molecular events associated with the protective effect of quercetin and myricetin were related to the elevated expression of photoreceptor-specific proteins, rhodopsin and cone opsins, decreased expression of the specific inflammatory markers, and the shift of the equilibrium between cell death regulators BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) and B-cell lymphoma 2 toward an antiapoptotic profile. These results were confirmed in photoreceptor-derived 661W cells treated with either H2O2 or all-trans-retinal stressors implicated in the mechanism of retinal degeneration. Altogether, flavonoids could have significant prophylactic value for retinal degenerative diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Flavonoids commonly present in food exhibit advantageous effects in blinding diseases. They bind to and stabilize unliganded rod opsin, which in excess accelerates degenerative processes in the retina. Additionally, flavonoids enhance the expression of the visual receptors, rod and cone opsins; inhibit the inflammatory reactions; and induce the expression of antiapoptotic markers in the retina, preventing the degeneration in vivo. Thus, flavonoids could have a prophylactic value for retinal degenerative diseases.", relevance: "0.22"},

The survival of both younger and elderly patients in the case of an optimal response has been prolonged and currently is close to survival of healthy population. Although, one third of patients does not respond well to first line imatinib and needs to change the treatment to second line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI: bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib). Younger patients without cardiologic and metabolic disorders and those with poor risk profile score may have benefit from TKI of 2nd generation as a 1st line treatment option with the aim of reaching deeper molecular response and the chance of treatment free remission (TFR) in future. By older patients with severe comorbidities and in patients with good risk profile score imatinib as a 1st line treatment option can be used. For patients who are resistant simultaneously to 2nd generation TKI and for patients with mutation T315I ponatinib - TKI of 3rd generation can be used effectively. Intolerance and toxicity of TKI´s are the main barriers of effective CML treatment. TKI selection for each patient should be individual.

We have estimated the potential amelioration role of quercetin against hepatic injury-induced apoptosis in rat foetuses following gestational exposure to fenitrothion and probable involvement of paraoxonase-1. Methods: Forty pregnant rats were allocated into four groups; the first one kept as control, the second intubated with quercetin (100 mg/kg), the third orally administrated fenitrothion (4.62 mg/kg) and the last group received quercetin two hours before fenitrothion intoxication. Results: Fenitrothion significantly elevated the foetal hepatic levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyl, and nitric oxide, but it reduced the enzymatic activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and acetylcholinesterase. Furthermore, fenitrothion provoked many histopathological changes in the foetal liver and markedly up-regulated the mRNA gene expression of p53, caspase-9 along with elevation in the immunoreactivity of Bax and caspase-3, but it down-regulated the expression level of paraoxonase-1. Remarkably, quercetin co-treatment successfully ameliorated the hepatic oxidative injury and apoptosis prompted by fenitrothion.

In our study, dams received PM2.5 and quercetin intervention during gestation and lactation, and then inflammation biomarkers, oxidative stress indicators, tight junction proteins, and gut microbiota in the colon of offspring were analyzed. Compared with the control group, lower catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, higher interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and interleukin-22 (IL-22), decreased ZO-1 and occludin expressions, and higher Bacteroides abundance were observed in the offspring mice of the PM2.5 group. However, higher CAT and SOD activities, lower IL-17A and IL-22 levels, increased ZO-1 and occludin expressions, and lower Bacteroides abundance were found in the quercetin groups. In addition, there was a negative correlation between Bacteroides abundance and CAT concentration. Additionally, Bacteroides abundance was positively related to IL-17A and IL-22 levels.

This study was conducted to evaluate effects of natural product quercetin on diquat-induced oxidative stress in porcine enterocytes and underlying mechanisms. Intestinal porcine epithelial cell line 1 (IPEC-1) cells pretreated with or without quercetin (5 μM, 24 h) were incubated with vehicle or diquat (100 μM) for 6 h. The results showed that diquat treatment induced apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner, as accompanied by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increased mitochondrial depolarization, and reduced the abundance of tight junction proteins. These adverse effects of diquat were remarkably abrogated by quercetin administration. Further study indicated that the protective effect of quercetin was associated with elevated protein abundance of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) content. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of quercetin on diquat-induced oxidative damage were abolished by all-trans-retinoic acid (Atra), a specific inhibitor of Nrf2, indicating a Nrf2-dependent regulation manner.

Since they develop suddenly and progress rapidly, the establishment of preventive strategies is urgently needed. Quercetin, a flavonoid abundant in various vegetables and fruits, is suggested to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, in this study, the preventive effect of quercetin was evaluated using a mouse model of aortic aneurysm and dissection. The model was established by administering angiotensin II (Ang II) and β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a lysyl oxidase inhibitor, to mice to induce hypertension and degeneration of the elastic lamina, which would eventually result in the onset of an aortic aneurysm. Ang II, BAPN, and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor was administered to induce aortic dissection via endothelial dysfunction. Quercetin (60 mg/kg/day) was administered 2 weeks before inducing aortic diseases by the end of the experiments (8 weeks in the aneurysm model, 6 weeks in the dissection model). It was found to reduce the incidence of aneurysm (from 72 to 45%), dissection (from 17 to 10%), and rupture (from 33 to 15%) in mice. Elastin degradation was ameliorated in the quercetin-treated mice compared to that in the mice without quercetin treatment (degradation score 2.9 ± 0.3 vs 2.2 ± 0.2).

Lonidamine is frequently used in cancer treatment, but its often preferred to be used in combination with other drugs because of its side effects. In the present study, the efficacy of the combination of lonidamine with quercetin, a flavonoid of natural origin, on human MCF-7 breast cancer cells was evaluated. The results showed that the combined use of the compounds significantly increased cytotoxicity compared to administration alone (p<0.0001). In addition, while lonidamine induced a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, administration of quercetin and its combination with lonidamine arrested the cell division at S point, indicating the synergistic strength of quercetin on cytotoxicity. The combination of quercetin and lonidamine significantly induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells (p<0.0001) and increased caspase levels (p<0.0001). In this study, the combination of quercetin and lonidamine has been evaluated for the first time and the combination treatment decreased MMP-2/-9 mRNA expression more potently than the effects of the compounds alone. The results showed that lonidamine was more effective when combined with quercetin, and their combination may be a candidate for a novel strategy of treatment for breast cancer.", relevance: "0.2"},

Currently several therapeutic strategies available to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. Though, most treatments can be associated with serious adverse effects what justifies the search for new treatments. In this sense, we highlight the interest in herbal products rich in bioactive compounds which immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties as is the case of Bryophyllum pinnatum (Crassulaceae). This plant is used in traditional medicine in Brazil for treating inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that hydroethanolic B. pinnatum leaf extract has intestinal anti-inflammatory effects on two experimental colitis models: 2.4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) in rats, and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Ultra-fast liquid chromatography method used for the quantification of the main compounds indicated good linearity, specificity, selectivity, precision, robustness and accuracy. The major flavonoids (mg/g of the extract) quantified were: quercetin 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (35.56 ± 0.086 mg/g), kaempferol 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (4.66 ± 0.076 mg/g) and quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside (4.56 ± 0.026 mg/g). The results obtained in the DNBS and DSS models indicate that extract has both chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory effects, observing a significant reduction in the disease activity index score, and less macroscopic and microscopic damage. The extract promoted downregulation of Toll-like receptor and kappa B p65 nuclear factor gene expression, leading to a reduction in pro-inflammatory and oxidative mediators, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. This immunomodulatory property was proposed that one of the possible action mechanisms of extract. An improvement in intestinal damage was also associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and infiltration of leukocytes, as evidenced by the reduction in malonaldialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity and increase in total glutathione in the colonic tissue. Moreover, the extract improved the cytoarchitecture of the colonic tissue and the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by restoring the expression of the proteins associated with mucosa protection. In view of the beneficial effects showed by the B. pinnatum leaf extract in preclinical rodent models of colitis there is the potential to conduct some future clinical studies to ensure safe and effective development of a phytotherapeutic treatment for human inflammatory bowel diseases.", relevance: "0.2"},

To solve these issues, precision cancer nanomedicine based on natural therapeutic materials is developed, which enables specifically apoptosis by interacting with genetic mutation in cancer cells, while leaving normal cells unaffected. Here, we report a novel nanomedicine (CuQDA/IO@HA) composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) / copper ion (Cu(II))-chelated dextran-aldehyde (DA)-quercetin (Q) with dual targeting for synthetic lethal therapy. The CuQDA/IO@HA prepared using a ratio of metal/Q at 0.5:1 resulted in a stable particle structure with uniform particle distribution. The CuQDA/IO@HA can specifically target and induce specific cytotoxicity in BRCA-mutant cancer cells in vitro. Combination treatment with CuQDA/IO@HA and magnetic navigation can induce poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and DNA damage in BRCA-mutant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) via CD44 targeting. The dual-targeting CuQDA/IO@HA can extend the median survival of the BRCA-mutant xenograft mice from 34 to 61 days in comparison to Q treatment alone in vivo, which is attributed to the significant increase in γH2AX, leading to significant apoptosis. More importantly, the CuQDA/IO@HA displayed biocompatibility and no obvious side-effect in normal organs.

Here we examined the mechanism of inhibition of enzymes involved in uric acid metabolism by quercetin, conjugates and microbial catabolites, and measured the effect of lowered circulating uric acid on endothelial cell gene expression. Methods: Inhibition of adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity by quercetin and metabolites was determined by HPLC. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured under conditions mimicking blood flow, treated with uric acid (0, 300 or 500 μmol/L), and changes in gene expression measured using transcriptomics and quantitative droplet digital PCR. Results: In human plasma, no inhibition of PNP activity was observed, and only quercetin weakly inhibited ADA. XOR was not present at sufficient amount in human plasma to use for testing, but quercetin, quercetin-3-sulfate and the gut microbial metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid inhibited bovine milk XOR. Several changes were observed in gene expression in HUVECs under flow compared to static conditions, but after uric acid treatment, only very few changes were detected. Conclusions: We propose that the main mechanism by which quercetin, as quercetin-3-sulfate, lowers uric acid in vivo is through inhibition of XOR, and not ADA nor PNP. The pertinent shift in uric acid concentration was not sufficient to produce significant changes in endothelial gene expression in a cell model.", relevance: "0.2"},

The current study investigates the extent to which quercetin (Q) and chrysin (CH) protect against vascular dysfunction in MetS rats. MetS was induced by feeding rats a high-salt diet (3%) and fructose-enriched water (10%) for 12 weeks. Thoracic aorta was isolated from MetS rats and from control rats, with the latter being injured by methylglyoxal (MG). Aortae were incubated with CH and Q, and vascular reactivity was evaluated through the analysis of aortic contraction and relaxation in response to PE and ACh, respectively. The formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the free radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were also evaluated following the introduction of CH and Q. The increased vasoconstriction and impaired vasodilation in MetS aortae were significantly ameliorated by Q and CH. Similarly, they ameliorated glycation-associated exaggerated vasoconstriction and impaired vasodilation produced by MG in control aortae. In addition, both Q and CH were effective in reducing the formation of AGEs and inhibition of glycosylation in response to MG or fructose treatment. Finally, Q successfully scavenged DPPH free radicals while CH showed significant vasodilation of precontracted aorta that was inhibited by L-NAME. In conclusion, Q and CH provide protection against vascular dysfunction in MetS by interfering with AGEs formations and AGEs-associated vascular deterioration, with CH being largely dependent on NO-mediated mechanisms of vasodilation.", relevance: "0.2"},

Effective anti-ageing strategies involving antioxidant supplementation and/or caloric restriction (CR) are receiving a great attention to mitigate free radical-mediated oxidative damage in several disease conditions to improve active longevity. Therefore, in this work, we have evaluated the protective effect of quercetin under non restriction (NR) and CR conditions on the sensitivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains (sod1∆, sod2∆, cta1∆, ctt1∆, tsa1∆ and glr1∆) deficient in antioxidant defence systems (superoxide dismutase, catalase, thioredoxin peroxidase and glutathione reductase) against H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that quercetin in combination with CR has strongly reduced the H2 O2 -mediated stress in the yeast mutant cells compared to NR conditions. Furthermore, we show that quercetin in combination with CR enhanced the percentage viability of yeast cells during chronological ageing. Our research findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation in combination with CR might have potent beneficial effects than individual therapies against free radical-mediated oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidant defense systems in our body. Supplementation with exogenous antioxidants is necessary to neutralize the free radical mediated damage. Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring plant compounds with strong free radical-scavenging activity and exhibits potent anti-aging property by mitigating oxidative stress. On the other hand, caloric restriction (CR) has been reported to be a popular leading anti-aging approach to ameliorate age-associate macromolecular damages in various chronic human diseases.

Previous studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) can prevent and treat aging-related diseases, but its pharmacological effects need to be further clarified. This study aimed to propose a network pharmacology-based method to identify the therapeutic pathways of EGb for aging. The active components of EGb and targets of sample chemicals were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database. Information on aging-related genes was obtained from the Human Ageing Genomic Resources database and JenAge Ageing Factor Database. Subsequently, a network containing the interactions between the putative targets of EGb and known therapeutic targets of aging was established, which was used to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of EGb for aging. A total of 24 active components, 154 targets of active components of EGb, and 308 targets of aging were obtained. Network construction and pathway enrichment were conducted after data integration. The study found that flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol) and beta-sitosterol may be the main active components of EGb. The top eight candidate targets, namely, PTGS2, PPARG, DPP4, GSK3B, CCNA2, AR, MAPK14, and ESR1, were selected as the main therapeutic targets of EGb. Pathway enrichment results in various pathways were associated with inhibition of oxidative stress, inhibition of inflammation, amelioration of insulin resistance, and regulation of cellular biological processes. Molecular docking results showed that PPARG had better binding capacity with beta-sitosterol, and PTGS2 had better binding capacity with kaempferol and quercetin.

Several researchers have suggested that iron chelators which cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) might have clinical efficacy in treating PD. Therefore, efforts are made not only in order to improve the effect of L-dopa but also to introduce drugs which provide anti-parkinsonian and neuroprotective effects. In this study, quercetin, a flavonoid, exhibited noticeable neuroprotective effects via iron induced-oxidative stress-dependent apoptotic pathways. Our results suggested that quercetin significantly decreased the catalepsy and exhibited neuroprotective effects in rotenone-induced Parkinson. A model of rotenone-induced Parkinsonism in rats produced the decrease in glutathione, SOD, catalase, and serum iron concentration and the increase in H2O2 and lipid peroxidation activity. Quercetin efficiently halted the deleterious toxic effects of L-dopa, revealing normalization of catalepsy and rotarod score, in addition to amelioration of neurochemical parameters, indicating benefit of both symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. In silico molecular docking studies have also shown that quercetin could be an ideal potential drug target for aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and human catechol-O-methyltransferase.

Dynamic light scattering was used to analyze the particle sizes of the three QUR-NPs. The results of stability tests showed that the three QUR-NPs had good storage and plasma stability. It was confirmed that plasma protein adsorption occurred for all three QUR-NPs. The results of DSC, DTG, XRPD, and Raman spectroscopy showed that there was no significant change in the crystal form of QUR for any of the three QUR-NPs compared with the commercial QUR. The in vitro dissolution rate of the three QUR-NPs was significantly faster than that of the micronized QUR, with the dissolution rate increasing as particle size decreased. All three QUR-NPs showed stronger in vitro inhibitory activity on MCF-7 cells than the pure QUR solution, with the largest NPs having the strongest inhibitory effect. The pharmacokinetic parameters in rats showed that the MRT and t1/2 of the QUR-NPs increased as particle size increased. QUR-NPs and the pure QUR solution showed obvious anti-tumor effects against murine hepatic carcinoma H22 model in vivo, although they were not as effective as cyclophosphamide (CTX). However, the anti-tumor effect of the large QUR-NPs combined with CTX was the strongest among all the tested groups. From the results of the thymus and spleen index, it was found that the QUR-NPs could not only regulate the immunity of tumor-bearing mice, but also alleviate the immunosuppression caused by CTX and protect normal tissues, all while enhancing the anti-tumor effect.

Methods: Thirty-six mice were randomly assigned to three treatments, including the control group (Ctr), DSS-induced colitis group (DSS) and DSS-induced colitis supplemented with 500 ppm quercetin (DQ500). Colitis was induced by DSS intake, and body weight was recorded every day. After six days administration of DSS, intestinal permeability was measured, and the liver was taken for antioxidant enzyme tests. Colonic tissue was taken for the histopathlogical score and RNA-sequencing analysis. Results: In this experiment, dietary quercetin for 500ppm alleviated the DSS-induced colitis, possibly by strengthening intestinal integrity, liver antioxidant capacity. Based on the results of the transcriptome of colon tissue, several key genes were modulated by quercetin. ERK1/2-FKBP pathway and RXR-STAT3 pathway were involved in the development of IBD, furthermore, in the down-regulation of S100a8/9, FBN2 contributed to lowering the risk of colongenesis. Conclusion: We demonstrated that dietary quercetin alleviated the DSS-induced colitis in mice. This is most likely due to its beneficial effects on intestinal integrity and modulation of several key pathways. Based on our research, quercetin was a promising candidate for IBD and its pharmaceutical effects on both IBD and colongenesis need further research.", relevance: "0.19"},

It has also been suggested to prolong the lifespan of, and enhance heat-stress tolerance in nematodes; thus, the present study investigated its effects on both the nematode life- and health span by assessing its capacity to promote nematode motility after aging and/or heat stress, as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects. The results of the conducted analyses showed that quercetin feeding prolonged lifespan, suppressed age-related motility retardation, improved motility recovery after heat stress, and decreased the production of both intercellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in the analysed Caenorhabditis elegans strains, likely by modulating the insulin-like signalling (ILS) pathway and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In particular, the transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 were found to mediate the observed quercetin-induced effects, consistent with their previously demonstrated roles as regulators of aging. Furthermore, we demonstrated, for the first time, that quercetin induced heat-stress tolerance in C. elegans by modulating HSF-1 expression and/or activity.

Quercetin has been reported to be effective in improving cognitive dysfunction in DE. But its detailed mechanism is still ambiguous. In this study, we used db/db mice to investigate whether quercetin could activate SIRT1 and inhibit ER pathways to improve DE. Behavioral tests (Morris water maze and new objects) showed that quercetin (70 mg/kg) can effectively improve the learning and memory ability in db/db mice. OGTT and ITT tests indicated that quercetin could alleviate impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in db/db mice. Western blot analysis and Nissl staining showed that quercetin can improve the expression of nerve and synapse-associated proteins (PSD93, PSD95, NGF and BDNF) and inhibit neurodegeneration. Meanwhile, quercetin up-regulates SIRT1 protein expression and inhibits the expression of ER signaling pathway-related proteins (PERK, IRE-1α, ATF6, eIF2α, BIP and PDI). In addition, oxidative stress levels were significantly reduced after quercetin treatment.

These results had considerable death burdens and negative influences on social-economic life. Since the appearance of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuous investigations have been carried out by researchers to find active compounds, mainly from plants, as natural sources, that could inhibit or stop the proliferation of the causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The most common symptoms caused by infections with COVID-19 can include cough, fever, and sore throat. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of active antiviral compounds for treating different strains of coronavirus. Herbal medicine is a class of medication that originates from nature and is aimed at decreasing the use of preservatives, excipients, or other additives and, consequently, lesser side effects. The rapid spread of COVID-19 infection besides the lack of knowledge about any treatments and the growing concern of the public from the virus directed us toward writing this review article in an aim to provide alternatives to the allopathic medicine use. There is a wealth of chemical diversity in the naturally existing compounds, including their antiviral activities, which may encourage their utilization as therapeutics against viral infections, including coronaviruses. The majority of publications on the herbal remedies of coronavirus, MERS, or SARS focused primarily on the use of polar compounds. These substances displayed encouraging inhibitory influences on coronavirus in humans. These include psoralidin, scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, caffeic acid, quercetin, myricetin, saikosaponin B2, griffithsin (lectins), and isobavachalcone.

Chemotherapy has shown promising results, but the accompanying side-effects cannot be neglected. Herein, we introduce novel flavones (TVF), which were characterized as 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside by UPLC-MS/MS, derived from the vine of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum (TV), a traditional Chinese herb and food. TVF exhibited outstanding anti-cancer abilities at the in vitro and in vivo level, and markedly triggered apoptosis via the Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway. The intrinsic mechanism study illustrated that TVF might induce apoptosis by activating autophagy by inhibiting the Akt-mTOR pathway, and the main component of TVF, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, enabled THR308 site binding to block the phosphorylation of Akt, which was further evidenced by molecular docking computation.

Hence, this research evaluated the antioxidant capability of quercetin (Qu) against silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) toxicity towards the lipid contents of ovarian, nervous, and hepatic systems as well as skeletal muscles. To this end, zebrafish (n = 180) were assigned into four experimental dietary groups: negative and positive controls, without Qu supplementation; Qu-200, 200 mg Qu per kg diet; and Qu-400, 400 mg Qu per kg diet. At the end of the feeding trial (40 days), the experimental groups, except the negative control, were exposed to sublethal concentration of AgNPs (0.15 mg L-1) for 96 h. As to the liver tissue of the positive and Qu-200 treatments, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (∑PUFA) decreased 3 times, as well as total high unsaturated fatty acids (∑HUFA) reduced about 30% and 50%, respectively. However, the brain ∑HUFA, predominated by DHA, enhanced in Qu-400 treatment. Interestingly, ∑MUFA, ∑PUFA, and ∑HUFA increased in the muscle of all treated groups, especially Qu-200 and Qu-400.

Surgical resection remains the only curative approach for CRC, but recurrence following surgery is the main problem and ultimate cause of death. Lycopodium clavatum and quercetin have been found to exert its anticancer properties. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether quercetin or L. clavatum extract and combination of both have any profound role in reducing major inflammatory cytokines in Colo-320 cells. Methods L. clavatum and Quercetin alone or in combination was administered to colon cancer cells and various toxicity markers, gene expression analyses of apototic genes and gelatin zymmography were performed. Results Quercetin (50 μm) in combination with L. clavatum extract (10 μL) distinctly reduced cell growth and highlighted their potential effects in extirpation of colon cancer cells. Treatment with increased dose of L. clavatum extract in combination with quercetin reduced the colony size and proliferation potential when compared to the sole treatment of plant extracts. In the antimicrobial assays, it was observed that Lycopodium alone exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Characterization of L. clavatum extract and quercetin was performed and confirmed the presence of flavonoids and alkaloids. Treatment with Lycopodium and quercetin combination induced significant down-regulation in activities of MMP2 and MMP9 tested by gelatin zymography. The combined treatment greatly affected the mRNA expression of p53, Bcl2, Bax, Caspase 3, Wnt 1, Cyclin D1, and Catalase genes in colon cancer cells.

Therefore, the present study was design to assess effects of WC or its active ingredient, quercetin (QE), against CPA-induced hepatotoxicity. For this study, 49 male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were randomly selected and categorized into seven equal groups. The animals were pre- and post-treated with both hydroalcoholic extract of WC (500 mg/kg) and quercetin (75 mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days, and intraperitoneal administration of CPA (200 mg/kg) was performed on only day 10, one hour before the last dose of WC or quercetin. On day 11, all the animals were sacrificed, and their blood and liver were gathered for evaluation of the liver enzyme, hepatic oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes activity, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. CPA significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PCO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels and liver biomarkers. Otherwise, hepatic catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiol content (tSH), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were considerably lower than the control group. Results showed that WC has the ability to reduce the changes (MDA, PCO, FRAP, CAT, ALT and AST) and QE (MDA, PCO, AST) induced by CPA (p < 0.05).

The heterogeneity of these studies in terms of evaluated agents, applied approaches and outcomes illustrates the need for an up-to-date summary and critical view on this rapidly growing field in endometriosis research. Objective and rationale: This review provides a comprehensive overview of plant-derived agents and natural treatment strategies that are under preclinical or clinical investigation and critically evaluates their potential for future endometriosis therapy. Search methods: An English language PubMed literature search was performed using variations of the terms endometriosis, natural therapy, herb/herbal, plant, flavonoid, polyphenol, phytochemical, bioactive, Kampo and Chinese medicine. It included both animal and human studies. Moreover, the Clinicaltrials.gov database was searched with the term endometriosis for clinical trials on plant-derived agents. No restriction was set for the publication date. Outcomes: Natural therapies can be assigned to three categories: (i) herbal extracts, (ii) specific plant-derived bioactive compounds and (iii) Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Agents of the first category have been shown to exert anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-oxidant effects on endometrial cells and endometriotic lesions. However, the existing evidence supporting their use in endometriosis therapy is quite limited. The most studied specific plant-derived bioactive compounds are resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, puerarin, ginsenosides, xanthohumol, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, quercetin, apigenin, carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, wogonin, baicalein, parthenolide, andrographolide and cannabinoids, with solid evidence about their inhibitory activity in experimental endometriosis models. Their mechanisms of action include pleiotropic effects on known signalling effectors: oestrogen receptor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1 and -6, tumour necrosis factor-α, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, nuclear factor-kappa B, matrix metalloproteinases as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis-related proteins. Numerous studies suggest that treatment with CHM is a good choice for endometriosis management. Even under clinical conditions, this approach has already been shown to decrease the size of endometriotic lesions, alleviate chronic pelvic pain and reduce postoperative recurrence rates. Wider implications: The necessity to manage endometriosis as a chronic disease highlights the importance of identifying novel and affordable long-term safety therapeutics. For this purpose, natural plant-derived agents represent promising candidates. Many of these agents exhibit a pleiotropic action profile, which simultaneously inhibits fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, such as proliferation, inflammation, ROS formation and angiogenesis. Hence, their inclusion into multimodal treatment concepts may essentially contribute to increase the therapeutic efficiency and reduce the side effects of future endometriosis therapy.", relevance: "0.18"},

The MSG group revealed variable degenerative and apoptotic changes in the motoneurons and neuroglia, a marked rise in the cytoplasmic caspase-3 expression in motoneurons and a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the astrocyte surface area percentage. In addition, the spinal cord tissue exhibited a significant elevation (p < 0.001) in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, INFɣ, caspase-3 activity and ATF2 pp expression as well as a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in SOD, IL-10 and GFAP levels compared with the control group.

It has been shown that certain compounds in diet can generate beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease due to its interactions with endothelial cells. Thus, this review is aimed at investigating whether certain polyphenols present in the Mediterranean diet, specifically catechin, quercetin, resveratrol, and urolithin, could exert positive effects on endothelial dysfunction. After analysis of numerous papers, we found that polyphenols aiding endothelial function is beneficial not only for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or endothelial dysfunction but for all people as it can improve the effects of aging on the endothelia. The additional benefit of these polyphenols on weight loss further improves health and lowers the risk of several diseases, including those caused by endothelial dysfunction. However, it is important to note that the dosages in the majorities of the studies mentioned in this review were of supplemental rather than nutritionally relevant quantities, and therefore, the recommended dosages are difficult to determine.", relevance: "0.18"},

Promotes Ascorbic Acid Uptake into Human Intestinal Caco-2 Cells via Enhancing the Gene Expression of Sodium-Dependent Vitamin C Transporter 1", abstract: "Acerola (Malpighia emarginata DC.) is a fruit containing abundant ascorbic acid (AsA) and numerous functional phytochemicals. We previously reported that the intake of acerola juice increased the absorption of AsA in plasma of healthy Japanese subjects. The functional phytochemicals in acerola may influence the intestinal epithelial cells to increase the cellular uptake of AsA. Therefore, in this study, we compared the AsA uptake into Caco-2 cells between AsA alone and that in acerola juice at the same concentration using a human intestinal model. Caco-2 cells were incubated with 3 mM AsA and 3 mM AsA in acerola juice. Intracellular AsA contents gradually increased until 24 h upon incubation with both AsA alone and AsA in acerola juice; however, these contents when incubated with AsA in acerola juice, were significantly higher than those incubated with AsA alone at 2, 3, 4, 8, and 24 h. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT) 1 was significantly higher in the cells incubated with AsA in acerola juice than those incubated with AsA alone. Moreover, polyphenols such as cyanidin-3-glucoside chloride and quercetin enhanced the SVCT1 gene expression in Caco-2 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that acerola polyphenols enhances the SVCT1 gene expression in Caco-2 cells and promotes AsA uptake.", relevance: "0.18"},

Both superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibition by tetrathiomolybdate (ATM) and catalase inhibition by 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (ATZ) increase and prolong the cytosolic Fe(II) signal after UVA irradiation. SOD inhibition with ATM also increases mitochondrial Fe(II). Thus, mitochondria do not source the UV-dependent increase in cytosolic Fe(II), but instead reflect and amplify raised cytosolic labile Fe(II) concentration. Hence control of cytosolic ferritin iron release is key to preventing UVA-induced inflammation. UVA irradiation also increases dermal endothelial cell H2O2, as monitored by the adenovirus vector Hyper-DAAO-NES(HyPer). These UVA-dependent changes in intracellular Fe(II) and H2O2 are mirrored by increases in cell superoxide, monitored with the luminescence probe L-012. UV-dependent increases in cytosolic Fe(II), H2O2 and L-012 chemiluminescence are prevented by ZnCl2 (10 μM), an effective inhibitor of Fe(II) transport via ferritins 3-fold channels. Quercetin (10 μM), a potent membrane permeable Fe(II) chelator, abolishes the cytosolic UVA-dependent FeRhonox1, Fe(II) and HyPer, H2O2 and increase in MitoFerroGreen Fe(II) signals. The time course of the quercetin-dependent decrease in endothelial H2O2 correlates with the decrease in FeRhox1 signal and both signals are fully suppressed by preloading cells with ZnCl2. These results confirm that antioxidant enzyme activity is the key factor in controlling intracellular iron levels, and hence maintenance of cell antioxidant capacity is vitally important in prevention of skin aging and inflammation initiated by labile iron and UVA.", relevance: "0.18"},

AhR is also modulated by various endogenous ligands e.g. highly potent tryptophan (Trp)-derivative FICZ (6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole) and natural ligands abundant in the human diet e.g. polyphenols. Therefore, evaluating AhR species-specific responses is crucial for understanding AhR physiological functions, establishing risk assessments, and exploring the applicability of AhR mediators in drug and food industry towards human-based usages. We studied AhR transactivation of FICZ/TCDD in vitro in a time-dependent and species-specific manner using dioxin responsive luciferase reporter gene assays derived from rat (DR-H4IIE) and human (DR-HepG2) hepatoma cells. We observed for the first time that FICZ potency was similar in both cell lines and was 40 times higher than TCDD in DR-HepG2 cells. Depleting Trp-derivative endogenously produced ligands by using culture medium without Trp, resulted in 3-fold higher AhR activation upon adding FICZ in DR-H4IIE cells, in contrast to DR-HepG2 cells which revealed a fast degradation of FICZ induction from 10 h post-exposure to complete disappearance after 24 h. Seven polyphenols and a mixture thereof, chosen based on commercially recommended doses and adjusted to human realistic exposure, caused rat and human species-specific AhR responses. Two isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) induced rat AhR synergistic effects with FICZ and/or TCDD, while quercetin, chrysin, curcumin, resveratrol, and the mixture exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the human AhR. Strikingly, resveratrol and quercetin at their realistic nanomolar concentrations acted additively in the mixture to abolish human AhR activation induced by various TCDD concentrations.

The current aim was to explore the benefits of the oral PC administration on the intestinal barrier integrity in animals. Methods: The effects of PCs on the intestinal barrier integrity in in vivo animal models of intestinal inflammation were assessed up-to August 2020 from the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases under the PRISMA methodology. The risk of bias was assessed from ARRAY and SCYRCLE tools. Results: From 1241 articles, 14 studies were included. In animals, oral resveratrol (n = 6) improves the intestinal barrier integrity and reduces intestinal damage. Additionally, grape seed extract (n = 2), curcumin (n = 1), genistein (n = 1), chlorogenic acid (n = 1), grape pomace (n = 1), olive leaf (n = 1) or cranberry extract (n = 1) improve the intestinal barrier integrity downregulating various inflammatory molecules (TNF-α, and other interleukins), and increasing the antioxidant enzymes in animals. Furthermore, resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocatechin, and other PCs improve the epithelial barrier integrity and pro-inflammatory molecule expression in the intestinal epithelia.

Conversely, phenolics are known bioactive compounds in grapes and display great antioxidant properties. However, the biological effects of the concomitant presence of phenolic compounds and OTA remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate, for the first time, the effect of OTA presence in Cabernet Sauvignon wine on antioxidant activity in vitro and on oxidative stress markers in vivo. In addition, the phenolic composition of wine was evaluated by LC-DAD-MS/MS. In vitro assays were based on spectrophotometric methods, while in vivo assays were performed evaluating oxidative stress markers in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, an alternative model to animal testing. A total of 23 phenolic compounds were identified in the Cabernet sauvignon red wine, including the anthocyanins delphinidin-3-O-glicoside and malvidin-3-O-glicoside, the flavonol quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and the phenolic acids caffeic, verbascoside and caftaric. Trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid were the only stilbenes found in the samples. OTA presence in the red wine was accompanied by reduction in GSH content and increase in hydroxyl radical generation in vitro. The presence of OTA in wine also increased lipoperoxidation and induced overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase in vivo. This study demonstrates that OTA presence in red wine can reduce its antioxidant potential in vitro and induces oxidative stress in vivo, without affecting the phenolic compounds levels in the samples. Thus, this work provides insights into the negative effects of the presence of OTA in wine, not only by its known toxicity, but also by prejudicing the antioxidant potential of wine.

Further MT induction collapsed in 8 days old transgenic worms, indicating the age dependency of disease outbreak, and sharing intriguing parallels to diminished MT levels in human brains of AD. A medium throughput screening assay method was established to search for compounds increasing the MT level.

Responses were compared after 6 weeks of growth in Aurora, South Dakota, USA. Plant heights between treatments were similar in Ames 21812, whereas branch number decreased when weeds were present. Ames 21789 was 45% shorter in weedy vs weed-free plots, but branch numbers were similar between treatments. Season-long biomass was reduced in response to weed stress in both lines. Common down-regulated subnetworks in weed-stressed plants were related to light, photosynthesis, and carbon cycles. Several unique response networks (e.g. aging, response to chitin) and gene sets were present in each line. Comparing transcriptomic responses of maize (determined in an adjacent study) and teosinte lines indicated three common gene ontologies up-regulated when weed-stressed: jasmonic acid response/signaling, UDP-glucosyl and glucuronyltransferases, and quercetin glucosyltransferase (3-O and 7-O).

Considering the inexplicable understanding of TAO pathogenesis, the disease worsens for the patients. Therefore, this manuscript provides insights into the recent advancements of clinical features, epidemiology, pathogenesis with gene-interactions, diagnosis, including available and novel treatment options for TAO, based on available data including RCTs, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Methods: Articles with clinical features, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease were thoroughly studied. To perform the gene expression and pathway analysis, articles were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrial.gov from 1982 to 2020. To predict novel TAO-specific therapeutic molecule, structure-based drug design (SBDD) was performed. Results: We observed gene expression and pathway analysis and SBDD approaches might bring new insights in the field of TAO pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. A genome-wide map of human genetic interactions revealed involvement of crucial cell-signalling pathways, such as TNF-mediated signalling pathway, type-I interferon signalling pathway, toll-like receptor signalling pathway, transforming growth factor-beta receptor signalling pathway etc. Recently, FDA-approved teprotumumab a breakthrough, first drug for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease, which reduces proptosis and the need for orbital decompression surgery. Furthermore, our SBDD results revealed that cost-effective Curcumin, Withaferin A, Resveratrol, Scopolamine, Quercetin, and Berberine may have significant binding affinity for hyaluronan protein and may be exploited for therapeutic purposes in TAO.

The phytochemicals p-coumaric acid and quercetin, which occur naturally in a wide variety of bee foods, including beebread and many types of honey, can enhance adult bee longevity and reduce the toxicity of certain pesticides. How variation in concentrations of natural dietary constituents affects interactions with xenobiotics, including synthetic pesticides, encountered in agroecosystems remains an open question. We tested the effects of these two phytochemicals at a range of natural concentrations on impacts of consuming propiconazole and chlorantraniliprole, a triazole fungicide and an insecticide frequently applied as a tank mix to almond trees during bloom in Californias Central Valley. Propiconazole, even at low field concentrations, significantly reduced survival and longevity when consumed by adult bees in a sugar-based diet. The effects of propiconazole in combination with chlorantraniliprole enhanced mortality risk. The detrimental effects of the two pesticides were for the most part reduced when either or both of the phytochemicals were present in the diet. These findings suggest that honey bees may depend on non-nutritive but physiologically active phytochemical components of their natural foods for ameliorating xenobiotic stress, although only over a certain range of concentrations; particularly at the high end of the natural range, certain combinations can incur additive toxicity.

Treatments of cancer include drugs, chemotherapy and radiotherapy or a combination. However, treatment of cancer by various therapeutic strategies often fail. One possible reason is that the nature of CSCs, which has stem-like properties, make it more dynamic and complex and may cause the therapeutic resistance. Another limitation is the side effects associated with the treatment of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To explore better or alternative treatment options the current study aims to investigate the natural drug-like molecules that can be used as CSC-targeted therapy. Among various natural products, anticancer potential of phenolics is well established. We collected the 21 phytochemicals from phenolic group and their interacting CSC genes from the publicly available databases. Then a bipartite graph is constructed from the collected CSC genes along with their interacting phytochemicals from phenolic group as other. The bipartite graph is then transformed into weighted bipartite graph by considering the interaction strength between the phenolics and the CSC genes. The CSC genes are also weighted by two scores, namely, DSI (Disease Specificity Index) and DPI (Disease Pleiotropy Index). For each gene, its DSI score reflects the specific relationship with the disease and DPI score reflects the association with multiple diseases. Finally, a ranking technique is developed based on PageRank (PR) algorithm for ranking the phenolics. Results: We collected 21 phytochemicals from phenolic group and 1118 CSC genes. The top ranked phenolics were evaluated by their molecular and pharmacokinetics properties and disease association networks. We selected top five ranked phenolics (Resveratrol, Curcumin, Quercetin, Epigallocatechin Gallate, and Genistein) for further examination of their oral bioavailability through molecular properties, drug likeness through pharmacokinetic properties, and associated network with CSC genes. Conclusion: Our PR ranking based approach is useful to rank the phenolics that are associated with CSC genes. Our results suggested some phenolics are potential molecules for CSC-related cancer treatment.", relevance: "0.17"},

Grewia mollis Juss (Malvaceae) is one of the medicinal herbs that is used traditionally to treat chronic diseases and related pain because currently used anti-inflammatory drugs may cause severe side effects, and naturally occurring compounds with reduced cytotoxicity could be explored for therapeutic goals. Materials and methods: Dried leaf of G. mollis was extracted with aqueous and organic solvents and partitioned based on polarity using solvent-solvent methods. The extracts were tested in anti-inflammatory assays against cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenase, and the safety profile was determined in a cell-based in-vitro assay. Results: The n-hexane fraction of G. mollis leaf extracts had significant activity against both COX-1 (IC50 =0.97±1.9 µg/mL) and COX-2 (IC50 =1.13±0.2 µg/mL) better than the indomethacin positive control (IC50 =1.3±0.6 and 1.52±0.2 µg/mL), respectively (p≤ 0.05). Also, all the extracts and fractions of G. mollis tested inhibited the activity of 15-LOX (IC50 =12.48±2.9 to 29.43±9.9 µg/mL) better than the quercetin reference control (IC50 =61.82±5.5 µg/mL), with the butanol fraction demonstrating the best anti-15 LOX action (IC50 =12.48±2.9 µg/mL). Furthermore, all the extracts and fractions of G. mollis had relatively lower cytotoxicity on vero monkey kidney cells (LD50 =30.56-479±0.07 µg/mL) compared to the doxorubicin positive control (LD50 =2.59 µg/mL), but the selectivity index (SI=1.04-1.89) determination suggested that some of the extracts may contain toxic constituents. Conclusion: Organic extracts of the leaves of Grewia mollis contained bioactive molecules with potent action on COX-2 and 15-LOX. Targeted high-resolution high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods have streamlined and enhanced bioactive compound isolation and purification process. This allows for the separation of undesirable compounds that could cause metabolic cytotoxicity in the plant extract mixtures.

Currently, there is no permanent cure to the disease, but it can be managed with several potent drugs that cause serious side effects on prolonged use. Traditional remedies are considered promising for the treatment of several diseases, particularly chronic conditions, because they have lower side effects compared to synthetic drugs. In folklore, the rhizome of Alpinia calcarata Roscoe (Zingiberaceae) is used as a major ingredient of herbal formulations to treat RA. Phytoconstituents reported in A. calcarata rhizomes are diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoid, flavonoids, phytosterol, and volatile oils. The present study is intended to understand the molecular-level interaction of phytoconstituents present in A. calcarata rhizomes with RA molecular targets using computational approaches. A total of 30 phytoconstituents reported from the plant were used to carry out docking with 36 known targets of RA. Based on the docking results, 4 flavonoids were found to be strongly interacting with the RA targets. Further, molecular dynamics simulation confirmed stable interaction of quercetin with 6 targets (JAK3, SYK, MMP2, TLR8, IRAK1, and JAK1), galangin with 2 targets (IRAK1 and JAK1), and kaempferol (IRAK1) with one target of RA. Moreover, the presence of these three flavonoids was confirmed in the A. calcarata rhizome extract using LC-MS analysis. The computational study suggests that flavonoids present in A. calcarata rhizome may be responsible for RA modulatory activity.

It is a fast-growing tumor that spreads to nearby brain regions specifically to cerebral hemispheres in frontal and temporal lobes. The etiology of GBM is unknown, but major risk factors are genetic disorders like neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis, which develop the tumor in the nervous system. The management of GBM with chemo-radiotherapy leads to resistance, and current drug regimen like Temozolomide (TMZ) is less efficacious. The reasons behind the failure of drugs are due to DNA alkylation in the cell cycle by enzyme DNA guanidase and mitochondrial dysfunction. Naturally occurring bioactive compounds from plants referred as phytochemicals, serve as vital sources for anti-cancer drugs. Some prototypical examples include taxol analogs, vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine), podophyllotoxin analogs, camptothecin, curcumin, aloe-emodin, quercetin, berberine etc. These phytochemicals often regulate diverse molecular pathways, which are implicated in the growth and progression of cancers. However, the challenges posed by the presence of BBB/BBTB to restrict the passage of these phytochemicals, culminates in their low bioavailability and relative toxicity.

It is well known that grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) can synthesize various flavonol glycosides in the leaves, however, very little information is available regarding their distribution along the cane at different leaf levels. In this work, taking into consideration of leaf position, the main flavonol glycosides of a red grapevine cultivar (Cabernet Sauvignon) were profiled and quantified by HPLC-DAD analysis. It was found that amount of four flavonol glycosides, namely, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide decreased towards the shoot tip. Since leaf age also decreases towards the shoot tip, the obtained results suggest that these compounds continuously formed by leaf aging, resulting in their accumulation in the older leaves. In contrast, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (predominant form) and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside were not accumulated significantly by aging.

Five experimental pre-treatment solutions were created using the following flavonoids: quercetin (QUE); hesperidin (HES); rutin (RUT); naringin (NAR), or proanthocyanidin (PRO). A placebo solution (PLA) with no flavonoids added was also evaluated. The flavonoids or placebo solutions were applied to the CAD prior to the application and photoactivation of a universal adhesive (Scotchbond Universal, 3M Oral Care). A control group (CON), in which only the bonding agent was applied without any flavonoid solution, was also evaluated. A 3-mm-thick block of resin composite (Opallis, FGM) was built up on the flat bonded CAD surfaces and was light-cured following the manufacturers instructions.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus. Although few molecules have been tested and shown some efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in humans but a safe and cost-effective attachment inhibitors are still required for the treatment of COVID-19. Natural products are gaining attention because of the large therapeutic window and potent antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study was planned to screen natural products from Ayurveda that have the potential to modulate host immune system as well as block the virus entry in host cells by interfering its interaction with cellular receptor and may be used to develop an effective and broad-spectrum strategy for the management of COVID-19 as well as other coronavirus infections in coming future. To decipher the antiviral activity of the selected natural products, molecular docking was performed. Further, the drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of the selected natural products were determined. Docking results suggest that curcumin and nimbin exhibits highest interaction with spike glycoprotein (MolDock score - 141.36 and - 148.621 kcal/mole) and ACE2 receptor (MolDock score - 142.647 and - 140.108 kcal/mole) as compared with other selected natural products/drugs and controls.

This can lead to the formation of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), a toxic derivative of cholesterol mainly produced by auto-oxidation. So, preventing the neuronal toxicity of 7KC is an important issue to avoid brain damage. As there are numerous data in favor of the prevention of neurodegeneration by the Mediterranean diet, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of a series of polyphenols (resveratrol, RSV; quercetin, QCT; and apigenin, API) as well as ω3 and ω9 unsaturated fatty acids (α-linolenic acid, ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA; docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, and oleic acid, OA) widely present in this diet, to prevent 7KC (50 µM)-induced dysfunction of N2a neuronal cells. When polyphenols and fatty acids were used at non-toxic concentrations (polyphenols: ≤6.25 µM; fatty acids: ≤25 µM) as defined by the fluorescein diacetate assay, they greatly reduce 7KC-induced toxicity. The cytoprotective effects observed with polyphenols and fatty acids were comparable to those of α-tocopherol (400 µM) used as a reference. These polyphenols and fatty acids attenuate the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and the 7KC-induced drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) measured by flow cytometry after dihydroethidium and DiOC6(3) staining, respectively. Moreover, the studied polyphenols and fatty acids reduced plasma membrane permeability considered as a criterion for cell death measured by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Our data show that polyphenols (RSV, QCT and API) as well as ω3 and ω9 unsaturated fatty acids (ALA, EPA, DHA and OA) are potent cytoprotective agents against 7KC-induced neurotoxicity in N2a cells.

PCa is the most frequently diagnosed cancer for men in several countries such as the USA. Permanently improving diagnostics and treatments in the PCa management causes an impressive divergence between, on one hand, permanently increasing numbers of diagnosed PCa cases and, on the other hand, stable or even slightly decreasing mortality rates. Still, aspects listed below are waiting for innovate solutions in the context of predictive approaches, targeted prevention and personalisation of medical care (PPPM / 3PM).A.PCa belongs to the cancer types with the highest incidence worldwide. Corresponding economic burden is enormous. Moreover, the costs of treating PCa are currently increasing more quickly than those of any other cancer. Implementing individualised patient profiles and adapted treatment algorithms would make currently too heterogeneous landscape of PCa treatment costs more transparent providing clear road map for the cost saving.B.PCa is a systemic multi-factorial disease. Consequently, predictive diagnostics by liquid biopsy analysis is instrumental for the disease prediction, targeted prevention and curative treatments at early stages.C.The incidence of metastasising PCa is rapidly increasing particularly in younger populations. Exemplified by trends observed in the USA, prognosis is that the annual burden will increase by over 40% in 2025. To this end, one of the evident deficits is the reactive character of medical services currently provided to populations. Innovative screening programmes might be useful to identify persons in suboptimal health conditions before the clinical onset of metastasising PCa. Strong predisposition to systemic hypoxic conditions and ischemic lesions (e.g. characteristic for individuals with Flammer syndrome phenotype) and low-grade inflammation might be indicative for specific phenotyping and genotyping in metastasising PCa screening and disease management. Predictive liquid biopsy tests for CTC enumeration and their molecular characterisation are considered to be useful for secondary prevention of metastatic disease in PCa patients.D.Particular rapidly increasing PCa incidence rates are characteristic for adolescents and young adults aged 15-40 years. Patients with early onset prostate cancer pose unique challenges; multi-factorial risks for these trends are proposed. Consequently, multi-level diagnostics including phenotyping and multi-omics are considered to be the most appropriate tool for the risk assessment, prediction and prognosis.

In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that early-life stress can exert long-lasting changes on the brain and microbiota, and this early adversity is associated with increased risk for developing depression in later life. The maternal separation (MS) model in rats is a robust paradigm to study the effects of early-life stress on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Recently, we have shown that polyphenols, naturally occurring compounds associated with several health benefits, have anti-stress effects in in vitro models. In this study, we assess the therapeutic potential of a variety of both flavonoid and non-flavonoid polyphenols in reversing the impact of MS on behaviour and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Rats underwent a dietary intervention with the naturally-derived polyphenols xanthohumol and quercetin, as well as with a phlorotannin extract for 8 weeks. Treatment with polyphenols prevented the depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours induced by MS, where xanthohumol effects were correlated with rescue of BDNF plasma levels. In addition, MS resulted in altered brain levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and dopamine, accompanied by abnormal elevation of plasma corticosterone. Although polyphenols did not reverse neurotransmitter imbalance, xanthohumol normalised corticosterone levels in MS rats. Finally, we explored the impact of MS and polyphenolic diets on the gut microbiota. We observed profound changes in microbial composition and diversity produced by MS condition and by xanthohumol treatment. Moreover, functional prediction analysis revealed that MS results in altered enrichment of pathways associated with microbiota-brain interactions that are significantly reversed by xanthohumol treatment. These results suggest that naturally-derived polyphenols exert antidepressant-like effects in MS rats, which mechanisms could be potentially mediated by HPA regulation, BDNF levels rescue and modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.", relevance: "0.17"},

Material and methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databanks were searched using the following MESH terms: zebrafish, cisplatin, ototoxicity. The identified publications were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and the 26 qualifying manuscripts were included in the full-text analysis. The experimental protocols, including cisplatin concentrations, the exposure duration and the outcome measurements used in zebrafish larvae studies, were evaluated and the reported knowledge was summarized. Results: Twenty-six substances protecting from cisplatin-induced toxicity were identified with the use of zebrafish larvae. These substances include quinine, salvianolic acid B, berbamine 6, benzamil, quercetin, dexmedetomidine, dexamethsanone, quinoxaline, edaravone, apocynin, dimethyl sulfoxide, KR-22335, SRT1720, ORC-13661, 3-MA, D-methionine, mdivi-1, FUT-175, rapamycin, Z-LLF-CHO, ATX, NAC, CYM-5478, CHCP1, CHCP2 and leupeptin. The otoprotective effects of compounds were attributed to their anti-ROS, anti-apoptotic and cisplatin uptake-blocking properties. The broadest range of protection was achieved when the experimental flow used preconditioning with an otoprotective compound and later a co-incubation with cisplatin. Protection against a high concentration of cisplatin was observed only in protocols using short exposure times (4 and 6 h). Conclusions: The data extracted from the selected papers confirm that despite the differences between the human and the zebra fish hearing thresholds (as affected by cisplatin), the sensory cells of zebrafish and larval zebrafish are a valuable tool which could be used: (i) for the discovery of novel otoprotective substances and compounds; (ii) to screen their side effects and (iii) to extend the knowledge on the mechanisms of cisplatin-induced inner ear damage. For future studies, the development of a consensus experimental protocol is highly recommended.", relevance: "0.17"},

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and hyaluronidase inhibition of T. laurifolia leaf extracts, prepared using reflux extraction with deionized water (RE) and 80% v/v ethanol using Soxhlets apparatus (SE), were determined. Rosmarinic acid, phenolics, and flavonoids contents were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography, Folin-Ciocalteu, and aluminum chloride colorimetric assays, respectively. Antioxidant activities were determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and linoleic acid-thiocyanate assays. MMP-1 inhibition was investigated using enzymatic and fluorescent reactions, whereas MMP-2, MMP-9, and hyaluronidase inhibition were investigated using gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxicity on human fibroblast cell line was also investigated. The results demonstrated that SE contained significantly higher content of rosmarinic acid (5.62% ± 0.01%) and flavonoids (417 ± 25 mg of quercetin/g of extract) but RE contained a significantly higher phenolics content (181 ± 1 mg of gallic acid/g of extract; p < 0.001). SE possessed higher lipid peroxidation inhibition but less DPPH• scavenging activity than RE. Both extracts possessed comparable hyaluronidase inhibition. SE was as potent an MMP-1 inhibitor as gallic acid (half maximal inhibitory concentration values were 12.0 ± 0.3 and 8.9 ± 0.4 mg/cm3, respectively). SE showed significantly higher MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibition than RE (p < 0.05). Therefore, SE is a promising natural anti-ageing ingredient rich in rosmarinic acid and flavonoids with antioxidant, anti-hyaluronidase, and potent MMPs inhibitory effects that could be applied in the cosmetic industry.", relevance: "0.17"},

Age-related neurodegeneration is progressive and leads to severe diseases affecting motility, memory, cognitive function, and social life. To date, no effective treatments are available for neurodegeneration and irreversible neuronal loss. Bioactive phytochemicals could represent a natural alternative to ensure active aging and slow onset of neurodegenerative diseases in elderly patients. Autophagy or macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved clearing process that is needed to remove aggregate-prone proteins and organelles in neurons and glia. It also is crucial in synaptic plasticity. Aberrant autophagy has a key role in aging and neurodegeneration. Recent evidence indicates that polyphenols like resveratrol and curcumin, flavonoids, like quercetin, polyamine, like spermidine and sugars, like trehalose, limit brain damage in vitro and in vivo. Their common mechanism of action leads to restoration of efficient autophagy by dismantling misfolded proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria. This review focuses on the role of dietary phytochemicals as modulators of autophagy to fight Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, fronto-temporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and psychiatric disorders.

However, not only is pure pADM not antibacterial, its mechanical properties are poor. In this study, an antibacterial pADM with good performance was prepared by adding two natural products as modifiers, quercetin (QCT) and tea tree oil (TTO). The result of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) proved that the addition of modifiers did not break the natural triple-helical structure of collagen. Meanwhile, the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), mechanic experiment, and enzymatic degradation demonstrated that pADM handled with QCT and TTO (termed QCT-TTO-pADM) had better thermal stability, mechanical strength, and resistance to enzymatic degradation than pADM. Meanwhile, QCT-TTO-pADM had excellent antibacterial activity and showed an antibacterial rate of over 80%. Furthermore, in the cytocompatibility analysis, QCT-TTO-pADM had no side effects on the adhesion, growth, and proliferation of fibroblasts. QCT-TTO-pADM could even accelerate wound healing more efficiently than pADM and glutaraldehyde-modified pADM (GA-pADM).

(Apocynaceae) is a deciduous, commonly ornamental, tropical plant grown in home premises, parks, gardens, graveyards, because of its beautiful and attractive flowers of various colours and size. The different parts of the plant are used traditionally to treat various diseases and conditions like leprosy, inflammation, diabetic mellitus, ulcers, wounds, itching, acne, toothache, earache, tongue cleaning, pain, asthma, constipation and antifertility. Aim of the review: The main aim of this review is to provide an overview and critically analyze the reported ethnomedical uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and toxicological studies of P. rubra and to identify the remaining gaps and thus supply a basis for further investigations. The review also focuses towards drawing attention of people and researchers about the wide spread pharmaceutical properties of the plant for its better utilization in the coming future. Material and methods: All the relevant data and information on P. rubra was gathered using various databases such as PubMed, Springer, Taylor and Francis imprints, NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), Science direct, Google scholar, Chemspider, SciFinder, research and review articles from peer-reviewed journals and unpublished data such as Phd thesis, etc. Some other grey literature sources such as webpages, ethnobotanical books, chapters, wikipedia were also studied. Results: More than 110 chemical constituents have been isolated from P. rubra including iridoids, terpenoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, alkaloids, glycosides, fatty acid esters, carbohydrates, animo acids, lignan, coumarin, volatile oils, etc. The important chemical constituents responsible for pharmacological activities of the plant are fulvoplumierin, plumieride, rubrinol, lupeol, oleanolic acid, stigmasterol, taraxasteryl acetate, plumieride-p-E-coumarate, rubranonoside, rubrajalellol, plumericin, isoplumericin, etc. The plant possess a wide range of pharmacological activities present namely antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, anticancer, anthelmintic, antifertility and many other activities. Conclusion: P. rubra is a valuable medicinal source and further study in this topic can validate the traditional and ethnobotanical use of the plant. However, many aspects of the plant have not been studied yet. The pharmacological activity of active chemical constituent isolated from the plant is proven only for a couple of activities hence, lack of bio-guided isolation strategies is observed. Further studies on bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action and structural activity relationship studies of isolated pure compounds will contribute more in understanding their pharmacological effects.

These elements combined with the fact that H. nummularium from the Alps has never been investigated prompted us to study the phytochemical composition of its aerial parts. The analysis of the polar extract allowed for the isolation of eight compounds: p-hydroxybenzoic acid, tiliroside, kaempferol, astragalin, quercetin, plantainoside B, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide.

Quercitrin is a common flavonoid in nature, and it exhibits antioxidant properties. Although the process of thrombogenesis is intimately related to cardiovascular disease risk, it is unclear whether quercitrin plays a role in thrombogenesis. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the antiplatelet effect of quercitrin in platelet activation. Methods: Platelet aggregation, granule secretion, calcium mobilization, and integrin activation were used to assess the antiplatelet activity of quercitrin. Antithrombotic effect was determined in mouse using ferric chloride (FeCl3)-induced arterial thrombus formation in vivo and thrombus formation on collagen-coated surfaces under arteriolar shear in vitro. Transection tail bleeding time was used to evaluate whether quercitrin inhibited primary hemostasis. Results: Quercitrin significantly impaired collagen-related peptide-induced platelet aggregation, granule secretion, reactive oxygen species generation, and intracellular calcium mobilization. Outside-in signaling of αIIbβ3 integrin was significantly inhibited by quercitrin in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of quercitrin resulted from inhibition of the glycoprotein VI-mediated platelet signal transduction during cell activation. Further, the antioxidant effect is derived from decreased phosphorylation of components of the TNF receptor-associated factor 4/p47phox/Hic5 axis signalosome. Oral administration of quercitrin efficiently blocked FeCl3-induced arterial thrombus formation in vivo and thrombus formation on collagen-coated surfaces under arteriolar shear in vitro, without prolonging bleeding time.

The most abundant compounds in all analyzed extracts were chlorogenic acid (209.8 to 1010.0 µg/g of DE) and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (114.7 to 1049.7 µg/g of DE). The studied extracts exhibited moderate to high skin-related activities. These properties were correlated with a high concentration of polyphenols. The present study demonstrated that Hemerocallis cultivars contain significant amounts of phenolic compounds with good skin-related activities and could be interesting as novel sources of bioactive agents for the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries.", relevance: "0.16"},

It is a dehydrogenase enzyme that performs electron transfer to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), while oxidizing hypoxanthin, which is an intermediate compound in purine catabolism, first to xanthine and then to uric acid. XO turns into an oxidant enzyme that oxidizes thiol groups under certain stress conditions in the tissue. The last metabolic step, in which hypoxanthin turns into uric acid, is catalyzed by XO. Uric acid, considered a waste product, can cause kidney stones and gouty-type arthritis as it is crystallized, when present in high concentrations. Thus, XO inhibitors are one of the drug classes used against gout, a purine metabolism disease that causes urate crystal storage in the joint and its surroundings caused by hyperuricemia. Urate-lowering therapy includes XO inhibitors that reduce uric acid production as well as uricosuric drugs that increase urea excretion. Current drugs that obstruct uric acid synthesis through XO inhibition are allopurinol, febuxostat, and uricase. However, since the side effects, safety and tolerability problems of some current gout medications still exist, intensive research is ongoing to look for new, effective, and safer XO inhibitors of natural or synthetic origins for the treatment of the disease. In the present review, we aimed to assess in detail XO inhibitory capacities of pure natural compounds along with the extracts from plants and other natural sources via screening Pubmed, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Academic. The data pointed out to the fact that natural products, particularly phenolics such as flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin, and scutellarein), tannins (agrimoniin and ellagitannin), chalcones (melanoxethin), triterpenes (ginsenoside Rd and ursolic acid), stilbenes (resveratrol and piceatannol), alkaloids (berberin and palmatin) have a great potential for new XO inhibitors capable of use against gout disease. In addition, not only plants but other biological sources such as microfungi, macrofungi, lichens, insects (silk worms, ants, etc) seem to be the promising sources of novel XO inhibitors.", relevance: "0.16"},

The present study aimed to identify the active chemical constituents of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and investigate their mechanisms through interleukin-6 (IL-6) integrating network pharmacological approaches. Methods: We collected the compounds from all herbal ingredients of the previously mentioned TCM, but those that could down-regulate IL-6 were screened through the network pharmacology approach. Then, we modeled molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity between compounds and IL-6. Furthermore, we analyzed the biological processes and pathways of compounds. Finally, we screened out the core genes of compounds through the construction of the protein-protein interaction network and the excavation of gene clusters of compounds. Results: The network pharmacology research showed that TCM could decrease IL-6 using several compounds, such as quercetin, ursolic acid, luteolin, and rutin. Molecular docking results showed that the molecular binding affinity with IL-6 of all compounds except γ-aminobutyric acid was < -5.0 kJ/mol, indicating the potential of numerous active compounds in TCM to directly interact with IL-6, leading to an anti-inflammation effect. Finally, Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to topologize the biological processes and pathways of compounds, revealing potential mechanisms for COVID-19 treatment. Conclusion: These results indicated the positive effect of TCM on the prevention and rehabilitation of COVID-19 in at-risk people.

The mice consumed a HFD with or without acid-treated rutin for 7 weeks. Body weight gain considerably decreased, by approximately 33%, in the acid-treated rutin (AR) and quercetin (Q) groups compared to that in the HFD group. The adipocytes size in epididymal fat in AR and Q groups was significantly reduced compared to that in the HFD group (p < 0.05). Treatment with AR decreased the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to the HFD group. In particular, administration of AR significantly decreased serum triglyceride (36.82 mg/dL) by 46% compared to HFD (69.30 mg/dL). The AR group also showed significantly decreased atherogenic indices and cardiac risk factors.

Coumarins and their derivatives exert a vast array of bioactive properties such as anticoagulant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, and enzyme inhibition. Higher doses of coumarin are found to be hepatotoxic however they exhibit beneficial effects by reducing the risk of cancer and other neuronal and cardiovascular ailments. Most of these effects can be attributed to their free radical scavenging effects. Coumarins such as umbelliferone, esculetin and quercetin show antioxidant properties and protect the cellular DNA from oxidative damage. The dicumarol shows anticoagulant properties by inhibiting the action of vitamin K, whereas angelmarin has been reported to be cytotoxic in pancreatic cancer. Coumarins also reduce edema and inflammation by inhibiting the prostaglandins biosynthesis. Hydroxyl aromatic substituted derivatives such as 5-hydroxycoumarin or vicinal dihydroxy coumarins have also been found to be potent anti-inflammatory agents. Some coumarins are approved by the FDA as drugs, and warfarin is one such example. It blocks the Vitamin K reductase enzyme thus disrupting the clotting mechanism.

Here we show that methanolic extract of the fungus Ganoderma applanatum offers protection against cardio- and hepatotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DOX) in Daltons Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) bearing mice. Treatment of DLA mice with 20 mg/kg of doxorubicin significantly increased the activities of serum toxicity markers including aspartate amino-transferase (AST), alanine amino-transferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, co-administration of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and G. applanatum (150 mg/kg) by oral gavage in DLA mice lowered the AST, ALT, and LDH activities when compared to DOX alone treatment. Treatment of DLA mice with DOX alone resulted in reduced GSH contents, and decreased the activities of glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Treatment of DOX-administered DLA mice with G. applanatum however increased the GSH content and elevated the activities of GST, CAT, and SOD. Among the various solvent extracts of G. applanatum, methanolic extract showed the highest phenolic (376.5 ± 15.24 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (4717.79 ± 170.22 mg quercetin/g) contents compared to the aqueous (216.3 ± 7.33 mg GAE/g) and chloroform extracts (137.27 ± 1.03 mg GAE/g). Consistently, the methanolic extract was found to possess the highest free radical scavenging activities when compared to the aqueous and chloroform extracts as measured by ABTS and DPPH assays.

However, this condition has lacked adequate attention; thus, to develop effective control measures, we determined ringworm prevalence, risk factors, and the direct-sample nested PCR diagnostic indices compared with the conventional methods of dermatophytes identification. Moreover, the phenolic composition of an Aloe vera gel extract (AGE) and its in vitro and in vivo antidermatophytic activity were evaluated and compared with those of antifungal drugs. Results: Of the 760 calves examined, 55.79% (424/760) showed ringworm lesions; 84.91% (360/424) were positive for fungal elements in direct-microscopy, and 79.72% (338/424) were positive in culture. Trichophyton verrucosum was the most frequently identified dermatophyte (90.24%). The risk of dermatophytosis was higher in 4-6-month-old vs. 1-month-old calves (60% vs. 41%), and in summer and winter compared with spring and autumn seasons (66 and 54% vs. 48%). Poor hygienic conditions, intensive breeding systems, animal raising for meat production, parasitic infestation, crossbreeding, and newly purchased animals were statistically significant risk factors for dermatophytosis. One-step PCR targeting the conserved regions of the 18S and 28S genes achieved unequivocal identification of T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes in hair samples. Nested-PCR exhibited an excellent performance in all tested diagnostic indices and increased the species-specific detection of dermatophytes by 20% compared with culture. Terbinafine and miconazole were the most active antifungal agents for dermatophytes. Gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, aloe-Emodin, quercetin, and rutin were the major phenolic compounds of AGE, as assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These compounds increased and synergized the antidermatophytic activity of AGE. The treated groups showed significantly lower clinical scores vs. the control group (P < 0.05). The calves were successfully treated with topical AGE (500 ppm), resulting in clinical and mycological cure within 14-28 days of the experiment; however, the recovery was achieved earlier in the topical miconazole 2% and AGE plus oral terbinafine groups. Conclusions: The nested PCR assay provided a rapid diagnostic tool for dermatophytosis and complemented the conventional methods for initiating targeted treatments for ringworm in calves.

Many studies reported the beneficial effects of honey in reversing metabolic syndrome through its antiobesity, hypoglycaemic, hypolipidaemic, and hypotensive actions. This review aims to provide an overview of the mechanism of honey in reversing metabolic syndrome. The therapeutic effects of honey largely depend on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of its polyphenol and flavonoid contents. Polyphenols, such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and gallic acid, are some of the phenolic acids known to have antiobesity and antihyperlipidaemic properties. They could inhibit the gene expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 and its target lipogenic enzyme, fatty acid synthase (FAS). Meanwhile, caffeic acid and quercetin in honey are also known to reduce body weight and fat mass. In addition, fructooligosaccharides in honey are also known to alter lipid metabolism by reducing FAS activity. The fructose and phenolic acids might contribute to the hypoglycaemic properties of honey through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B insulin signalling pathway. Honey can increase the expression of Akt and decrease the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B. Quercetin, a component of honey, can improve vasodilation by enhancing nitric oxide production via endothelial nitric oxide synthase and stimulate calcium-activated potassium channels.

Studies have also been conducted for superoxide scavenging activity of the DCA (78.82%) and methanolic extract of seed pods (84.28%) compared to quercetin as standard (82.08%). Theoretically, it has been determined by density-functional theory(DFT) calculations using M06-2X hybrid functional and the double-ζ- split-valence 6-31G (d, p) basis set that the nitric oxide scavenging activity of the compound is by the addition of NO radical at double bond position. Predicted biological activity profile of DCA suggests that it has less activity probability (Pa) for toxicity (Pa = 0.730), cytotoxicity (Pa = 0.208), compared to those chemical entities that are already known as anticancer agents indicating that DCA is less toxic and more tolerable for normal cells. Furthermore, molecular docking studies of the DCA with different studied cancer-related receptors [Estrogen receptor (- 60.12 kcal/mol), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (- 30.33 kcal/mol), estrogen receptor alpha (- 4.82 kcal/mol), uPAR (- 32.55 kcal/mol) and an enzyme having lipid kinase activity phosphoinositide 3-kinase (- 55.94 kcal/mol)] were found to have better binding affinities compared to betulinic acid and doxorubicin.

Leaf of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn), which has been used for medicinal purposes, contains various active ingredients, including polyphenols, and is reported to exert an antioxidant effect. In this study, we investigated the effect of water extract of lotus leaf (LL) on muscle atrophy and the underlying molecular mechanisms of action. Amounts of 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg/day LL were administered to dexamethasone (DEX)-induced muscle atrophy mice for 4 weeks. Micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis revealed that the intake of LL significantly increased calf muscle volume, surface area, and density in DEX-induced muscle atrophy mice. Administration of LL recovered moving distance, grip strength, ATP production, and body weight, which were decreased by DEX. In addition, muscle damage caused by DEX was also improved by LL. LL reduced the protein catabolic pathway by suppressing gene expression of muscle atrophy F-Box (MAFbx; atrogin-1), muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), and forkhead box O (FoxO)3a, as well as phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). The AKT-mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway, which is important for muscle protein synthesis, was increased in LL-administered groups. The HPLC analysis and pharmacological test revealed that quercetin 3-O-beta-glucuronide (Q3G) is a major active component in LL. Thus, Q3G decreased the gene expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 and phosphorylation of AMPK. This compound also increased phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its upstream enzyme AKT in DEX-treated C2C12 cells. We identified that LL improves muscle wasting through regulation of muscle protein metabolism in DEX-induced muscle atrophy mice. Q3G is predicted to be one of the major active phenolic components in LL. Therefore, we propose LL as a supplement or therapeutic agent to prevent or treat muscle wasting, such as sarcopenia.", relevance: "0.16"},

Characterized polyphenolic extracts from the French medicinal plants Antirhea borbonica, Ayapana triplinervis, Dodonaea viscosa and Terminalia bentzoe, and their major polyphenols quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic and gallic acids limited the pro-inflammatory and permeability alterations caused by high glucose. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist also attenuated these damages while PPARγ antagonist aggravated them, suggesting PPARγ protective action. Interestingly, polyphenols improved PPARγ gene expression lowered by high glucose. Moreover, polyphenols were detected at the intracellular level or membrane-bound to cells, with evidence for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) efflux transporter role. Altogether, these findings emphasize the ability of polyphenols to protect cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition and their relevance for pharmacological strategies aiming to limit cerebrovascular disorders in diabetes.", relevance: "0.16"},

Epidemiological evidence about the associations between these flavonoid biomarkers and breast cancer risk is limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum concentration of these flavonoids and breast cancer risk among Chinese women. Methods: This hospital-based case-control study recruited 792 breast cancer cases and 813 age frequency-matched (5-year interval) controls who provided eligible blood samples in Guangdong Province, China. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure flavonoids. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence internal (CI). Results: Higher concentrations of serum flavonols, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, flavanones and naringenin were significantly associated with lower breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for the highest versus the lowest group of 0.66 (0.49-0.89) for flavonols, 0.52 (0.38-0.70) for isorhamnetin, 0.60 (0.45-0.80) for kaempferol, 0.65 (0.49-0.87) for flavanones and 0.45 (0.34-0.60) for naringenin, respectively. Significant positive associations were observed between serum flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and breast cancer risk. No significant associations were observed for serum quercetin, flavones, apigenin, luteolin, hesperetin, catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin-3-gallate with overall breast cancer risk. Conclusions: This study suggested that serum flavonols and flavanones were inversely associated with breast cancer risk and serum flavan-3-ols were positively associated with breast cancer risk. Serum flavones were not associated with overall breast cancer risk. These findings warrant further confirmation in prospective studies.", relevance: "0.16"},

In this study, we investigated if those Rosa multiflora flower (RMF) extracts prevent ultraviolet (UV)-induced biochemical damages leading to photoaging. In keratinocyte or dermal fibroblasts, RET, REA, and RBT treatments with UV irradiation significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 levels through suppression of nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases. In the animal experiment, mice were orally supplemented with RET (RET group) or REA and RBT mixture (RM group) for 10 weeks, concomitantly with UV exposure. Tumor necrosis factor alpha production and MMP-13 expression were reduced in the mouse skin of RET and RM groups compared with those in the UV control (UVC) group. UV-induced IL-6 production and epidermal thickening were reduced in RM group compared with those in UVC group. Eight phenolic compounds, including quercitrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside), were identified in RMF extracts. Quercitrin treatment to dermal fibroblasts significantly attenuated an increase of MMP-1 expression and a decrease of type I procollagen expression caused by UV. Collectively, RMF extracts showed protective effects from UV-induced photoaging in the skin through suppression of ROS generation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and MMP expression. Quercitrin is suggested to be one of the effective compounds.", relevance: "0.16"},

Medicinal plants hold great promise against diabetes. The traditional use of Cleome droserifolia as an antidiabetic agent was correlated to its flavonol glycosides content. In the current study, five major flavonol glycosides appeared on the RP-HPLC chromatogram of the aqueous extract namely; quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucosyl-7-O-α-rhamnoside (1), isorhamnetin-7-O-β-neohesperidoside (2), isorhamnetin-3-O-β-d-glucoside (3) kaempferol-4-methoxy-3,7-O-α-dirhamnoside (4), and isorhamnetin-3-O-α-(4″-acetylrhamnoside)-7-O-α-rhamnoside (5). The inhibitory activities of these compounds were tested in vitro against several enzymes involved in diabetes management. Only the relatively less polar methoxylated flavonol glycosides (4, 5) showed mild to moderate α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Compounds 1-4 displayed remarkable inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme (IC50 0.194 ± 0.06, 0.573 ± 0.03, 0.345 ± 0.02 and 0.281 ± 0.05 µg/mL, respectively) comparable to vildagliptin (IC50 0.154 ± 0.02 µg/mL). Moreover, these compounds showed high potential in preventing diabetes complications through inhibiting aldose reductase enzyme and combating oxidative stress. Both isorhamnetin glycoside derivatives (2, 3) exhibited the highest activities in aldose reductase inhibition and compound 2 (IC50 5.45 ± 0.26 µg/mL) was even more potent than standard quercetin (IC50 7.77 ± 0.43 µg/mL). Additionally, these flavonols exerted excellent antioxidant capacities through 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant (FRAP) assays.", relevance: "0.16"},

Moreover, NAFLD is also considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance and inflammation have been identified as key factors in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Although the mechanisms associated with the development of NAFLD remain to be fully elucidated, a complex interaction between adipokines and cytokines appear to play a crucial role in the development of this condition. Adiponectin is the most common adipokine known to be inversely linked with insulin resistance, lipid accumulation, inflammation and NAFLD. Consequently, the focus has been on the use of new therapies that may enhance hepatic expression of adiponectin downstream targets or increase the serum levels of adiponectin in the treatment NAFLD. While currently used therapies show limited efficacy in this aspect, accumulating evidence suggest that various dietary polyphenols may stimulate adiponectin levels, offering potential protection against the development of insulin resistance, inflammation and NAFLD as well as associated conditions of metabolic syndrome. As such, this review provides a better understanding of the role polyphenols play in modulating adiponectin signaling to protect against NAFLD. A brief discussion on the regulation of adiponectin during disease pathophysiology is also covered to underscore the potential protective effects of polyphenols against NAFLD. Some of the prominent polyphenols described in the manuscript include aspalathin, berberine, catechins, chlorogenic acid, curcumin, genistein, piperine, quercetin, and resveratrol.", relevance: "0.16"},

Therefore, the current study investigates the potential of T. spruneriana as a new alternative in terms of natural bioactive components. In this context, antioxidant activity, enzyme inhibition, and phenolic compounds of different extracts including ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous were identified. The results show that the ethyl acetate (113.59 ± 2.73 mg GAE/g) has the highest phenolic content, but ethanol extract has the highest scavenging activity for DPPH and TAC. The ethanol extract showed stronger inhibition on cholinesterase and α-amylase compared to other extracts. Besides, 12 bioactive compounds were characterized in T. spruneriana extracts by HPLC-DAD. Our findings support that T. spruneriana could be considered as a new source of active phytochemicals, as well as provide remarkable data on biological activities of some main enzymes playing role in the healing of hyperpigmentation, Alzheimer, and diabetes. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study reports the total content, types and amounts of bioactive compounds and potential beneficial bioactivities of the different extracts of T. spruneriana. Trigonella is abundant in nature and spread over a wide geographical area, and is used in making cheese, pastries, spices, and sausages in different countries, as well as for antidiabetic purposes. Trigonella leaves are a good source of bioactive compounds that contain compounds like quercetin, catechin, cinnamic acid, and coumaric acid, along with it have also a high content of soluble fibers and is suggested for body weight control. Apart from being the first study conducted to point out the potential of T. spruneriana as being a natural food additive, this study also demonstrated its medicinal importance by revealing the anti-hyperpigmentation, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties of T. spruneriana.", relevance: "0.16"},
