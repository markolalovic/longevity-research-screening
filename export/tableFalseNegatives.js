The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of second-generation TKIs on thyroid function. Methods: We retrospectively assessed the effect of the first-generation TKI imatinib and the second-generation TKI nilotinib and dasatinib on thyroid function tests in 73 Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Results: Overall, 33 of 73 (45%) had one or more thyroid function test abnormalities during follow-up. Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism were found in 18 of 73 (25%) and 21 of 73 (29%) cases after a median of 6 and 22 weeks, respectively. In most patients (29 of 39, 74%) thyroid dysfunction was transient without clinical symptoms. Therapy of hypo-/hyperthyroidism was required in three patients. Thyroid dysfunction never resulted in the discontinuation of TKI therapy. Under treatment with imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, thyroid abnormalities were detected in 25%, 55%, and 70%, respectively. Four of 55 patients (7%) treated with nilotinib had evidence for an autoimmune thyroiditis (antibody positive in 3 of 4 patients) with an episode of hyperthyroidism preceding hypothyroidism. Conclusions: Thyroid dysfunction is a common adverse event with second-generation TKI therapy in patients with Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Although the mechanism is still unclear, the high frequency of thyroid abnormalities, including autoimmune thyroiditis, warrants regular and long-term monitoring of thyroid function in these patients.", relevance: "0.48"},

However, whether senescence contributes to renal dysfunction in these conditions remains unclear. Quercetin is an abundant dietary flavonoid that selectively clears inhibiting PI3K/AKT and p53/p21/serpines and inducing apoptosis. We hypothesized that high-fat-diet-induced obesity causes renal senescence, which would be mitigated by quercetin. C57BL/6J mice fed either standard chow or high-fat diets (HFDs) were treated with quercetin (50 mg/kg) or vehicle 5-days biweekly via oral gavage for 10 weeks. Subsequently, renal function was studied in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging, and renal senescence and histology were evaluated ex vivo. Mice fed with a HFD developed obesity and hypercholesterolemia, whereas renal size remained unchanged. Murine obesity impaired renal function and cortical oxygenation, and induced glomerulomegaly. Renal markers of senescence (eg, expression of p16, p19, and p53) and its secretory phenotype were upregulated in the obese hypercholesterolemic compared to lean mice in renal tubular cells, but attenuated in quercetin-treated murine kidneys, as was renal fibrosis. Quercetin treatment also increased renal cortical oxygenation and decreased plasma creatinine levels in obese mice, whereas body weight and cholesterol levels were unaltered. Therefore, murine obesity and dyslipidemia induce renal tissue senescence and impairs kidney function, which is alleviated by chronic senolytic treatment. These findings implicate senescence in loss of kidney function in murine dyslipidemia and obesity, and support further studies of senolytic therapy in obesity.", relevance: "0.46"},

Its maintenance influences the rate of ageing and it is determined by several factors, including efficient proteolysis. The proteasome is the major cellular proteolytic machinery responsible for the degradation of both normal and damaged proteins. Alterations of proteasome function have been recorded in various biological phenomena including ageing and replicative senescence. Proteasome activities and function are decreased upon replicative senescence, whereas proteasome activation confers enhanced survival against oxidative stress, lifespan extension and maintenance of the young morphology longer in human primary fibroblasts. Several natural compounds possess anti-ageing/anti-oxidant properties. In this study, we have identified quercetin (QUER) and its derivative, namely quercetin caprylate (QU-CAP) as a proteasome activator with anti-oxidant properties that consequently influence cellular lifespan, survival and viability of HFL-1 primary human fibroblasts. Moreover, when these compounds are supplemented to already senescent fibroblasts, a rejuvenating effect is observed. Finally, we show that these compounds promote physiological alterations when applied to cells (i.e. whitening effect). In summary, these data demonstrate the existence of naturally occurring anti-ageing products that can be effectively used through topical application.", relevance: "0.41"},

Prior to the use of quercetin in food applications that would increase intake beyond that from naturally-occurring levels of the flavonol in the typical Western diet, its safety needs to be established or confirmed. This review provides a critical examination of the scientific literature associated with the safety of quercetin. Results of numerous genotoxicity and mutagenicity, short- and long-term animal, and human studies are reviewed in the context of quercetin exposure in vivo. To reconcile results of in vitro studies, which consistently demonstrated quercetin-related mutagenicity to the absence of carcinogenicity in vivo, the mechanisms that lead to the apparent in vitro mutagenicity, and those that ensure absence of quercetin toxicity in vivo are discussed.

Imatinib was the first to be introduced into clinical oncology, and it was followed by drugs such as gefitinib, erlotinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and dasatinib. Although they share the same mechanism of action, namely competitive ATP inhibition at the catalytic binding site of tyrosine kinase, they differ from each other in the spectrum of targeted kinases, their pharmacokinetics as well as substance-specific adverse effects. With variations from drug to drug, tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause skin toxicity, including folliculitis, in more than 50% of patients. Among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are commercially available as yet, the agents that target EGFR, erlotinib and gefitinib, display the broadest spectrum of adverse effects on skin and hair, including folliculitis, paronychia, facial hair growth, facial erythema, and varying forms of frontal alopecia. In contrast, folliculitis is not common during administration of sorafenib and sunitinib, which target VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3, and others, whereas both agents have been associated with subungual splinter hemorrhages. Periorbital edema is a common adverse effect of imatinib. Besides the haematological side effects of most of TKIs like anemia, thrombopenia and neutropenia, the most common extra-heamatologic adverse effects are edema, nausea, hypothyroidism, vomiting and diarrhea.

Although the activity of quercetin is believed to be due to its antioxidative properties, it has recently been suggested that quercetin also has prooxidant activities, which might effect cytotoxicity directly. In this study, we used mouse thymocytes to investigate whether quercetin behaved as a protector against oxidative stress or as a cytotoxic agent. Quercetin treatment did not induce oxidative damage, but protected mouse thymocytes from glucose oxidase (GO)-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that quercetin (50 microM) treatment suppressed the GO-mediated DNA binding activity of redox state-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB, AP-1, and p53. This result suggests that quercetin has antioxidative effects on thymocytes. More interestingly, quercetin treatment alone (50 microM) increased the DNA-binding activity of AP-1, which consisted of heterodimer of c-Jun and Fra-2. Finally, the antioxidant activity of quercetin was confirmed using a cell-free system of radical generation. Our findings suggest that quercetin protects mouse thymocytes from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and modulates the intracellular redox state through its antioxidant activity.", relevance: "0.31"},

A phase 1 dose escalation study was performed to evaluate the safety of quercetin in 30 untreated patients with chronic HCV infection and to preliminarily characterize quercetins potential in suppressing viral load and/or liver injury. Quercetin displayed safety in all trial participants. Additionally, 8 patients showed a clinically meaningful 0.41-log viral load decrease.

Isolated quercetin is also marketed as a dietary supplement, mostly as the free quercetin aglycone, and frequently in daily doses of up to 1000 mg d-1 exceeding usual dietary intake levels. The present review is dedicated to safety aspects of isolated quercetin used as single compound in dietary supplements. Among the numerous published human intervention studies, adverse effects following supplemental quercetin intake have been rarely reported and any such effects were mild in nature. Published adequate scientific data for safety assessment in regard to the long-term use (>12 weeks) of high supplemental quercetin doses (≥1000 mg) are currently not available. Based on animal studies involving oral quercetin application some possible critical safety aspects could be identified such as the potential of quercetin to enhance nephrotoxic effects in the predamaged kidney or to promote tumor development especially in estrogen-dependent cancer.

When these normal human cells were incubated with each flavonoid in culture medium for 24 h, some of the flavonoids showed considerable cytotoxicity at relatively high concentrations and in a dose-dependent manner. 3-Hydroxyflavone, luteolin, and apigenin were more toxic toward TIG-1 cells than the other flavonoids, and luteolin, 3-hydroxyflavone, and quercetin were more toxic toward HUVE cells. HUVE cells were more vulnerable to flavonoid cytotoxicity than TIG-1 cells. Using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA), the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level of flavonoid-treated TIG-1 cells was examined. The ROS level increased significantly in the presence of the flavone apigenin or luteolin or the flavonol 3-hydroxyflavone, quercetin, or kaempherol. These results suggest that these flavones and flavonols exert cytotoxicity through increasing intracellular ROS levels. Further, the incorporation of apigenin, 3-hydroxyflavone, luteolin, and quercetin, which are more toxic, into TIG-1 cells during 24-h incubation was examined. These flavonoids were incorporated into them and the order of their incorporation efficiency was similar to that of their cytotoxicity.

Objective: To assess the risk of vascular occlusive events in patients with CML treated by new generations of TKIs and provide an overall assessment of the clinical benefit. Data sources: Two independent reviewers selected studies from PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane library database from their inception to October 21, 2014. Abstracts published during the past 3 years at international congresses and a trial register were also searched. Study selection: Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and titles against inclusion and exclusion criteria published previously in the PROSPERO 2014 protocol: CRD42014014147.

Methods: In order to evaluate the risk of CF, adjusted reporting odds ratios (aRORs) were calculated for the 15 anticancer PKIs in the World Health Organization safety report database (VigiBase®). We realised a literature review to identify 21 protein kinases (PKs) that were possibly involved in CF caused by PKIs. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between aRORs and affinity data of the 15 PKIs for the 21 PKs were calculated to identify the cellular target most likely to be involved in PKI-induced CF.

Imatinib is associated with very low rates of thrombosis, suggesting a potentially protecting cardiovascular effect of this treatment in patients with BCR-ABL CML. This protective effect might be mediated by decreased platelet secretion and activation, decreased leukocyte recruitment, and anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic effects. Clinical data have guided mechanistic studies toward alteration of platelet functions and atherosclerosis development, which might be secondary to metabolism impairment.
